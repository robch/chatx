While GitHub Copilot has revolutionized the IDE experience and Project Padawan is advancing autonomous issue resolution, a comprehensive terminal-based AI assistant represents the critical third leg of this strategy.\r\n\r\nThis paper outlines a vision for GitHub Copilot CLI, a next-generation Terminal Development Environment that would exceed the capabilities of Claude Code and other terminal-based coding assistants. Beyond simple code generation, GitHub Copilot CLI would empower developers with unprecedented context-gathering capabilities, putting them in control of how and when AI assistance is leveraged while providing powerful tools that surpass what\u0027s available in today\u0027s IDEs.\r\n\r\nAs a critical component of GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy, GitHub Copilot CLI would bridge the gap between the highly interactive IDE experience and the fully autonomous workflow of Project Padawan, allowing developers to be the \u0022superheroes\u0022 who decide exactly how AI augments their workflow.\r\n\r\n## The Terminal AI Coding Assistant Landscape\r\n\r\n### Current Market Leaders\r\n\r\nThe terminal-based AI coding assistant market currently includes several notable products:\r\n\r\n**Aider (Open Source)**: A git-integrated AI pair programmer with multi-file editing capabilities and repository mapping. It supports multiple AI models but lacks advanced context generation and enterprise features.\r\n\r\n**Claude Code (Anthropic)**: The most comprehensive terminal-based coding assistant, featuring deep code understanding, multi-file awareness, git integration, and a tiered permission system. It excels in its reasoning capabilities, GitHub integration, and support for Model Context Protocol (MCP). It has limitations in platform support (requiring WSL on Windows) and AI model providers.\r\n\r\n**My Coder (Ben Houston)**: An AI-powered command-line tool designed to integrate directly into existing development workflows. It stands out for its multi-provider support, robust local model capabilities, deep GitHub integration, browser-related research features, GitHub CI/CD integration, and support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\r\n\r\n**GitHub CLI Copilot Extension**: Focused specifically on command suggestions and explanations rather than comprehensive code editing or context exploration.\r\n\r\n**Goose (Block)**: An open-source AI development agent with both CLI and desktop interfaces. Goose stands out for its extensive cross-platform support (written in Rust), persistent session management, deep GitHub integration, and extensive third-party integrations via Model Context Protocol (MCP). It includes unique capabilities like screenshot UI analysis, voice interaction, and context-aware project understanding.\r\n\r\n### Key User Needs Not Fully Addressed\r\n\r\nResearch into user feedback reveals several critical needs in this space:\r\n\r\n1. **Developer-Controlled Context Gathering**: The need for powerful tools to systematically explore and curate context that far exceeds current IDE capabilities.\r\n2. **Cost Management**: Addressing expensive per-token pricing scenarios.\r\n3. **Windows Support**: Native Windows experience without requiring workarounds like WSL.\r\n4. **Multi-Model Flexibility**: Flexible selection of the AI model based on the task at hand.\r\n5. **Variable Autonomy**: The ability to adjust the balance between developer control and AI autonomy.\r\n6. **Deep GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub workflows, from issues and PRs to branch management.\r\n7. **Advanced Research Capabilities**: Browser automation and external context integration are essential for modern coding assistants.\r\n8. **Extensibility and Customization**: The ability for developers to create their own tools, workflows, and integrations that match their unique development processes.\r\n\r\n## Vision for GitHub Copilot CLI\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI would transform the terminal-based AI coding experience by providing a \u0022slider\u0022 between highly interactive assistance and autonomous operation, all while empowering developers with unprecedented context-gathering capabilities.\r\n\r\n### The Context Exploration Difference\r\n\r\nAt the heart of GitHub Copilot CLI\u0027s differentiation is a revolutionary approach to code exploration and context gathering:\r\n\r\n1. **Advanced Context Gathering Commands**: Powerful tools for developers to explicitly explore codebases:\r\n   - Glob-based file searching (\u0060**/*.js\u0060) and filtering (\u0060grep\u0060-like).\r\n   - Web search integration for up-to-date information not already available.\r\n   - Linguistic analysis of found files/pages/content via prompt pipelines.\r\n\r\n2. **Developers-in-Control Philosophy**: Unlike tools that either make developers add files manually or rely entirely on AI judgment, GitHub Copilot CLI empowers developers to:\r\n   - Explicitly build on-target context, not too much nor too little ... it\u0027s just right.\r\n   - Generate documentation from the codebase, for both team members and AI\u0027s growth over time.\r\n   - Guide the AI\u0027s focus precisely where it\u0027s needed, or let it roam freely, or anywhere in between.\r\n\r\n3. **Context Refinement Capabilities**: Tools to optimize gathered context:\r\n   - Summarization of large codebases, extracting key components and relationships.\r\n   - Multiple altitudes of context, from high-level overviews to PoV-specific understandings.\r\n   - Human guided or AI automated refinement of context.\r\n\r\n4. **Conversation Management Features**: Capabilities to maintain context across time and create branching explorations:\r\n   - Saving conversation history to persistent storage and reloading it in future sessions.\r\n   - Creating \u0022conversation branches\u0022 to explore different paths from a common starting point.\r\n   - Supporting aliases for common conversation workflows and contexts.\r\n\r\n5. **Customization and Extensibility Framework**: Rich capabilities for developers to tailor and extend functionality:\r\n   - Embracing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for third-party integrations.\r\n   - Custom chat commands, prompts, and aliases for frequently used operations.\r\n   - Rich prompt templating, variable substitution, and iterative evaluation capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Foundational Pillars\r\n\r\n1. **The Context Slider**: A revolutionary approach that allows developers to control how much context gathering they do explicitly versus delegating to the AI, creating a true \u0022superhero\u0022 experience where developers amplify their own expertise.\r\n\r\n2. **Provider-Agnostic Intelligence**: Support for multiple AI providers with Just-in-time model selection based on the specific operation, balancing capability, cost, and privacy.\r\n\r\n3. **Native Cross-Platform Excellence**: True native support across Windows, macOS, and Linux with special optimizations for Windows Terminal and PowerShell workflows.\r\n\r\n4. **Seamless Command Interface**: A unified command surface that combines conversational AI interaction with powerful terminal operations through an intuitive interface.\r\n\r\n5. **Complete GitHub Integration**: Deep connections to GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, workflows, and actions, creating a seamless experience across the GitHub ecosystem.\r\n\r\n6. **Open Extensibility Platform**: An extensible architecture that embraces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for third-party integrations, along with custom commands, prompts, aliases, and workflows.\r\n\r\n### Key Differentiating Capabilities\r\n\r\n1. **Developer-Led Context Exploration**: Unlike Claude Code\u0027s automated approach or other tools\u0027 limited file selection, GitHub Copilot CLI would provide developers with superior tools to explore, curate, and refine context before engaging the AI.\r\n\r\n2. **Variable Autonomy Model**: The ability to fluidly move between high developer control (explicit context, guided assistance) and high AI autonomy (independent AI exploration, solution generation).\r\n\r\n3. **Extensive Model Selection**: Just-in-time model selection allows choosing the most optimal AI model for each task, ensuring a balance between capability, cost, and performance.\r\n\r\n4. **Cross-Environment Awareness**: Maintain context awareness across terminal sessions, repositories, and even between GitHub Copilot CLI and GitHub Copilot in IDEs.\r\n\r\n5. **Enterprise-Ready Collaboration**: Designed with team and organization-wide features in mind, with shared context, team-based workflows, and enterprise settings and controls.\r\n\r\n## The Three Pillars of GitHub\u0027s AI Strategy\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI would complete GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy:\r\n\r\n1. **GitHub Copilot in IDEs**: Deeply embedded assistance where developers write code, offering suggestions, chat, and agent capabilities within the development environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Project Padawan**: Autonomous issue and PR handling that works independently on GitHub tasks, treating the AI as another team member that developers interact with through familiar GitHub interfaces.\r\n\r\n3. **GitHub Copilot CLI**: The critical middle ground that empowers developers and teams to be \u0022superheroes\u0022 in their own journey, controlling precisely how they leverage AI through powerful context exploration and refinement, flexible autonomy model, and extensive customization and extensibility.\r\n\r\nThis three-pillar approach creates a complete spectrum of AI assistance, from highly interactive to fully autonomous, allowing developers to choose the right approach for each task.\r\n\r\n## Competitive Differentiation\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI would differentiate from Claude Code and other competitors through:\r\n\r\n1. **Developer-Controlled Context**: Superior tools for developer-led context exploration versus Claude Code\u0027s automated but opaque approach.\r\n\r\n2. **GitHub Integration**: Seamless connection to the GitHub ecosystem versus limited or no GitHub awareness in current tools.\r\n\r\n3. **Platform Excellence**: True native Windows support versus Claude Code\u0027s Linux-centric design.\r\n\r\n4. **Advanced Research Capabilities**: Integrated web search and browser automation combined with a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for seamless extension with specialized tools.\r\n\r\n5. **Conversation Management**: Sophisticated conversation saving, loading, and branching capabilities that enable developers to maintain context over time and explore multiple solution paths.\r\n\r\n6. **Developer-Centric Customization**: Unparalleled flexibility for developers to create, share, and reuse custom workflows, commands, and integrations that match their unique development processes.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI represents the critical third pillar in GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy. By empowering developers with unprecedented context exploration capabilities and a flexible autonomy model, it bridges the gap between the highly interactive GitHub Copilot experience in IDEs and the fully autonomous approach of Project Padawan.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental differentiator is a developer-centric philosophy that recognizes developers as the \u0022superheroes\u0022 in the development process, providing them with context gathering superpowers far beyond what\u0027s available in today\u0027s IDEs. This approach puts developers firmly in control of how and when they leverage AI assistance, allowing them to adjust the level of autonomy to match each specific task.\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI\u0027s conversation management capabilities further enhance this developer-centric approach by enabling persistent context maintenance across time, tasks, and teams, exploration of multiple solution paths through conversation branching, and effective knowledge sharing across organizations. These features create a true context-rich environment where development teams can build on previous work, explore alternatives, and maintain comprehensive project history.\r\n\r\nBy building GitHub Copilot CLI with these principles at its core, GitHub would create a terminal-based AI development environment that not only exceeds the capabilities of Claude Code and other competitors but also completes a cohesive vision for AI-assisted development across all developer workflows.\r\n\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 1 - Why Now? Strategic Timing\r\n\r\nThe terminal-based AI assistant market represents a critical and rapidly closing window of opportunity. Several factors make this the ideal moment to launch GitHub Copilot CLI:\r\n\r\n1. **Rapidly Maturing Competitive Landscape**: Claude Code, MyCoder, and other tools are quickly establishing user expectations and workflows. The longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes to change developer habits.\r\n\r\n2. **Context Window Revolution**: Recent exponential growth in AI model context windows (from 8K to 200K\u002B tokens) has fundamentally changed what\u0027s possible in code comprehension. This creates a unique opportunity to introduce context exploration capabilities that weren\u0027t previously viable.\r\n\r\n3. **Terminal Renaissance**: We\u0027re experiencing a resurgence in terminal-based development with modern CLI tools, making this an optimal moment to integrate AI into this workflow.\r\n\r\n4. **Completion of the AI Strategy Triangle**: GitHub Copilot in IDEs and Project Padawan (autonomous agents) address two critical AI assistance models, but the middle ground\u2014where developers explicitly drive context gathering\u2014remains unclaimed territory with enormous strategic value.\r\n\r\n5. **Rising Complexity of Development**: The proliferation of microservices, distributed systems, and polyglot codebases has dramatically increased the context-switching burden on developers, creating urgent demand for better context management tools.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 2 - Why Microsoft/GitHub? Strategic Advantage\r\n\r\nMicrosoft and GitHub are uniquely positioned to lead in this space, with competitive advantages that create a compelling strategic imperative:\r\n\r\n1. **Contextual Knowledge Advantage**: GitHub\u0027s unparalleled visibility into code, issues, PRs, and workflows across millions of repositories provides a unique understanding of development contexts that competitors cannot match.\r\n\r\n2. **The Copilot Brand Promise**: The Copilot brand stands for AI assistance that amplifies developer capabilities rather than replacing them\u2014perfectly aligned with the \u0022developer as superhero\u0022 philosophy of GitHub Copilot CLI.\r\n\r\n3. **Windows Leadership Position**: Microsoft\u0027s ownership of Windows Terminal and PowerShell provides unique opportunities for deep integration on the Windows platform\u2014a critical advantage over competitors like Claude Code that struggle with Windows support.\r\n\r\n4. **Developer Ecosystem Defense**: Terminal-based development represents a critical touchpoint in the developer workflow that Microsoft cannot afford to cede to competitors, as it would create a vulnerability in Microsoft\u0027s comprehensive developer toolchain.\r\n\r\n5. **Full SDLC Protection**: This completes Microsoft\u0027s AI-assisted coverage across the entire software development lifecycle, preventing competitors from establishing beachheads in any part of the development workflow.\r\n\r\n6. **Platform Integration Opportunities**: Unique integration possibilities with Azure, Visual Studio, VS Code, and the broader Microsoft ecosystem create differentiation that is difficult for competitors to replicate.\r\n\r\n7. **GitHub as the Developer Center**: This reinforces GitHub\u0027s position as the center of the developer universe by extending integrated AI assistance to all developer touchpoints, strengthening the overall ecosystem.\r\n\r\n8. **Data Flywheel Effect**: Context gathering at scale provides valuable insights to improve future AI models, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement that benefits all Microsoft developer products.\r\n\r\nIf Microsoft does not move quickly to establish leadership in this space, we risk creating a vulnerability in our developer strategy that competitors will exploit, potentially eroding our position in the broader developer ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 3 - Terminal Renaissance\r\n\r\nThere is substantial data-driven evidence demonstrating that we\u0027re experiencing a significant resurgence in terminal usage and innovation - a true \u0022terminal renaissance\u0022 that creates a strategic imperative for GitHub Copilot CLI.\r\n\r\n### Key Evidence Categories\r\n\r\n1. **Investment Signals \u0026 Market Recognition**\r\n   - Significant venture capital funding for terminal-focused startups (e.g., Warp Terminal raised $60M\u002B with a $290M\u002B valuation)\r\n   - Major platform investments like Microsoft Windows Terminal and cross-platform PowerShell\r\n   - Growing commercial recognition of terminal importance in developer workflows\r\n\r\n2. **Developer Adoption Metrics**\r\n   - Stack Overflow Survey shows 71% of professional developers use command-line interfaces daily\r\n   - JetBrains data indicates 92% of developers use the terminal at least weekly\r\n   - GitHub CLI exceeded 6 million installations with strong growth trajectory\r\n\r\n3. **Terminal Productivity Tool Explosion**\r\n   - Terminal customization tools like Oh My Zsh have grown to 177,000\u002B GitHub stars\r\n   - Modern CLI tools like Ripgrep (50,000\u002B stars) and fzf (69,000\u002B stars) showing massive adoption\r\n   - Package managers like Homebrew seeing 26.5% year-over-year growth\r\n\r\n4. **DevOps Movement Driving CLI Usage**\r\n   - Infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, Kubernetes) requiring terminal proficiency\r\n   - 85% of organizations using some form of GitOps (primarily CLI-driven)\r\n   - CI/CD pipelines predominantly configured through terminal-based interfaces\r\n\r\n5. **Terminal Feature Evolution**\r\n   - Modern terminals now support rich content, GPU acceleration, and advanced multiplexing\r\n   - 74% of VS Code\u0027s 25M\u002B monthly active developers use its integrated terminal\r\n   - Growth of cloud development environments making terminal interfaces central\r\n\r\nThis data paints a clear picture that terminal usage isn\u0027t declining\u2014it\u0027s experiencing a renaissance with growing adoption, investment, and innovation. Believing Microsoft and GitHub could delay entering this space would be a grave strategic miscalculation. The terminal renaissance is not a passing trend; it\u0027s a fundamental shift in how developers work, and GitHub Copilot CLI is the perfect solution to capitalize on this momentum.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 4 - Real-World User Scenarios\r\n\r\n### Scenario 1: The Enterprise Architect Exploring a New Microservice Architecture\r\n\r\nAn enterprise architect needs to understand a complex microservice architecture with dozens of services before planning a refactoring strategy.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Claude Code:**\r\nThe architect manually points Claude code to what they think are the important files, but they don\u0027t know what they don\u0027t know. Claude can search files but lacks the sophisticated context-building tools needed for systematic exploration.\r\n\r\n**GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**\r\n\r\n Instead of manually selecting files for context, GitHub Copilot CLI enables systematic exploration with explicit commands.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\r\n# Step 1: Find and analyze all service definitions across the codebase\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*Service.{js,ts}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Extract the service name, its dependencies, and main responsibilities\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022exploration/services/{fileBase}-analysis.md\u0022\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize all service definitions and their relationships\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/services/service-definitions-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Discover API routes and their relationships to services\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/routes/**/*.{js,ts}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022router\\.(get|post|put|delete)\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Extract each endpoint, which service it uses, and what resources it accesses\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022exploration/routes/{fileBase}-endpoints.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize all API routes and service relationships, in markdown, with links\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/routes/api-routes-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Analyze database interactions\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022mongoose|sequelize|knex|prisma\u0022 --exclude \u0022node_modules\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Identify which database collections/tables are accessed and how\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022exploration/database/{fileBase}-db-access.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize access patterns and relationships to services\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/database/db-access-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 4: Generate service dependency graph\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022exploration/**/*.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Create mermaid diagram showing relationships between services based on above\u0022 \\  \r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/service-dependencies.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 5: Generate refactoring recommendations\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022exploration/**/*.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Based on all the gathered information about services, routes, and database access patterns, suggest a refactoring strategy to improve modularization and reduce coupling\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/refactoring-strategy.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022exploration/microservice-analysis.jsonl\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 6: Create GitHub issues for each recommendation\r\ngithub-copilot --file \u0022exploration/refactoring-strategy.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Create GitHub issues for each recommendation; include description and acceptance criteria\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/refactoring-github-issues.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 7: Kick off fixing each issue w/ Project Padawan\r\ngithub-copilot --file \u0022exploration/refactoring-github-issues.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Assign issues that have no dependencies to \u0060Copilot\u0060\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 8: Later, branch the conversation to explore alternative refactoring approaches\r\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \u0022exploration/microservice-analysis.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022exploration/alternative-approach.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Let\u0027s explore an alternative refactoring strategy that prioritizes data consistency over service autonomy\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022exploration/alternative-refactoring-strategy.md\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis approach allows the architect to systematically explore the codebase in a way that aligns with how experienced architects think, progressively building understanding and leaving behind artifacts that can be shared with the team.\r\n\r\n### Scenario 2: The Senior Developer Researching a Security Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA security audit across multiple services can be slow if done manually by a developer, and the AI might miss key areas of the codebase if left to its own devices.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Claude Code:**\r\nThe developer asks Claude to help find vulnerabilities, but linguistically struggles to guide it to the right areas of the codebase. They manually suggest files or patterns they suspect, but the lack of determinism often leads to a haphazard investigation.\r\n\r\n**GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI provides commands for identifying authentication code, input validation analysis, and composite security report generation, allowing developers to focus on the most relevant areas of the codebase.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\r\n# Step 1: Find all authentication and authorization code\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022authenticate|authorize|login|session|token|jwt\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Identify potential security vulnerabilities related to authentication\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/auth/{fileBase}-vulnerabilities.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize authentication and authorization code, including potential vulnerabilities\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/auth/authentication-vulnerabilities-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Examine input validation across the codebase\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --contains \u0022validate|sanitize|escape\u0022 \\\r\n  --lines-before 10 --lines-after 10 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Analyze whether inputs are properly validated before use\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/validation/{fileBase}-analysis.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities\r\ngithub-copilot \u0022Find SQL query construction\u0022 --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --contains \u0022SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE.*FROM\u0022 \\\r\n  --lines-before 100 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Check if any SQL queries are constructed in a way that could allow SQL injection attacks\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/sql/{fileBase}-injection-risks.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize SQL query construction and potential injection risks\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/sql/sql-injection-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 4: Analyze HTTP header handling for security issues\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022header|ContentType|X-\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Check for proper HTTP header validation and security-related headers\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/headers/{fileBase}-analysis.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize HTTP header handling and potential security issues\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/headers/http-headers-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 5: Process all the findings to identify the vulnerability\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022security-audit/**/*.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Based on all the collected security analyses, identify the most likely vulnerability that matches the reported issue, its root cause, and recommended remediation steps\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/vulnerability-report.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 6: Generate a patch for the vulnerability\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022security-audit/vulnerability-report.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Generate pull request that addresses the identified vulnerabilities, in a new branch\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/fixsecurity-vulnerability-pr.md\u0022\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis approach allows the developer to conduct a systematic security audit, focusing on different security aspects and building a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability before generating a fix locally.\r\n\r\n### Scenario 3: Learning a New Framework through Web Research and Codebase Exploration\r\n\r\nBy integrating web search commands and file exploration, GitHub Copilot CLI lets developers learn new frameworks\u2014combining the benefits of explicit context collection with deep analysis, a strategy similar to MyCoder\u2019s integrated research and code exploration features.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Claude Code:**\r\nThe developer would need to use a separate tool for web research, and then manually share that information with Claude Code. The exploration process is disjointed and inefficient.\r\n\r\n**GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\r\n# Step 1: Research Next.js best practices from the web\r\ngithub-copilot web search \u0022Next.js best practices 2025\u0022 --max 5 \\\r\n  --page-instructions \u0022Extract key architectural patterns and best practices for Next.js applications\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-page-output \u0022nextjs-learning/best-practices-{counter}.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Find specific examples and implementation techniques\r\ngithub-copilot --save-alias nextjs-learning-examples\\\r\n  --page-instructions \u0022Extract concrete code examples and implementation techniques\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-page-output \u0022nextjs-learning/examples-{filebase}.md\u0022\r\ngithub-copilot web search --queries @search-terms-one-search-per-line.txt \\\r\n  --nextjs-leaning-examples\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Explore current Next.js usage in the codebase\r\ngithub-copilot \u0022Explore current Next.js implementation\u0022 --glob \u0022**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022next|getServerSideProps|getStaticProps|useRouter\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Analyze how Next.js features are currently being used in this codebase\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022nextjs-learning/current-usage/{fileBase}-analysis.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 4: Identify areas for improvement\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022nextjs-learning/**/*.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Based on the web research on Next.js best practices and performance optimization, compare with the current implementation to identify specific areas for improvement\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022nextjs-learning/improvement-opportunities.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 5: Generate learning roadmap\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022nextjs-learning/**/*.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Create a personalized learning roadmap for mastering Next.js based on the gathered information and the specific needs of the current codebase\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022nextjs-learning/learning-roadmap.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 6: Generate implementation plan for a new feature\r\ngithub-copilot \u0022Plan new feature implementation\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Create an implementation plan for adding a new user profile feature using Next.js best practices based on all the gathered context\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022nextjs-learning/feature-implementation-plan.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 7: Generate GitHub issues for the new feature\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022nextjs-learning/feature-implementation-plan.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Create GitHub issues for each task in the implementation plan, including descriptions and acceptance criteria\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022nextjs-learning/feature-github-issues.md\u0022\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis approach seamlessly combines web research with codebase exploration, allowing the developer to learn the framework concepts while understanding their practical application in the existing codebase before they begin on their implementation.\r\n\r\n### Scenario 4: Debugging a Complex Production Issue with Cross-Service Dependencies\r\n\r\nFor debugging intermittent production issues, GitHub Copilot CLI provides thorough log analysis and code tracing commands. \r\n**GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\r\n# Step 1: Gather error logs from all services\r\ngithub-copilot \r\n  run \u0022kubectl logs --selector=app=transaction-service -n production --tail=500\u0022 -- \\\r\n  run \u0022kubectl logs --selector=app=payment-service -n production --tail=500\u0022 -- \\\r\n  run \u0022kubectl logs --selector=app=user-service -n production --tail=500\u0022 \\\r\n  | github-copilot \\\r\n    --add-user-prompt -

GitHub Copilot CLI\u0027s conversation management capabilities make this possible through conversation saving, loading, and branching.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Other Tools:**\r\nDevelopers must either maintain one continuous conversation (risking token limits and confusion) or start fresh conversations (losing valuable context). There\u0027s no easy way to explore alternative paths while preserving the original context.\r\n\r\n**GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\r\n# Day 1: Start working on a new feature and save the conversation\r\ngithub-copilot \u0022Let\u0027s design a new authentication system using OAuth 2.0\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/initial-design.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-trajectory \u0022projects/auth-system/initial-design.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Day 3: Continue the conversation with preserved context\r\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/initial-design.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/implementation-planning.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Now let\u0027s plan the implementation details for our OAuth 2.0 system\u0022\r\n\r\n# Day 5: Create a branch to explore an alternative approach\r\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/implementation-planning.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/alternative-jwt-approach.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Let\u0027s explore an alternative implementation using JWTs instead\u0022\r\n\r\n# Day 6: Return to the original implementation path\r\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/implementation-planning.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/oauth-implementation.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Let\u0027s continue with our original OAuth 2.0 implementation\u0022\r\n\r\n# Day 10: Combine insights from both conversation branches\r\ngithub-copilot \\\r\n  --input-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/oauth-implementation.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Let\u0027s review the key decisions we made for the OAuth implementation\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022projects/auth-system/oauth-summary.md\u0022 -- \\\r\n  --input-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/alternative-jwt-approach.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Let\u0027s review the key aspects of our JWT approach\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022projects/auth-system/jwt-summary.md\u0022 -- \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Compare these two approaches and create a hybrid solution that takes the best elements from both\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/hybrid-solution.jsonl\u0022\r\n\r\n# Manage token usage for long-running conversations\r\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/hybrid-solution.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --output-chat-history \u0022projects/auth-system/hybrid-solution.jsonl\u0022 \\\r\n  --trim-token-target 160000 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Optimize our hybrid auth solution for performance\u0022\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis approach enables the developer to maintain context over extended periods, explore different solution paths without losing original context, and effectively manage token usage for long-running projects. The conversation branches serve as documentation of the development journey and can be referenced later to understand design decisions.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 5 - Open Questions\r\n\r\n### Business \u0026 Strategy\r\n\r\n1. **Business Model \u0026 Monetization**: How does GitHub Copilot CLI integrate into our existing monetization strategy?

I would have sort of imagined that this would look like \u0060gh copilot\u0060 instead of \u0060github-copilot\u0060.  I am not sure if that decision is something we need to concern ourselves with early, but I think it might put constraints on how we build this CLI (since I think then the path of least resistance would be to use \u0060go\u0060 like other gh extensions?)\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## ghcp\\github-cli-spec-reboot-direction-my-thoughts-input.md\n\nModified: 32 minutes ago\nSize: 10 KB\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060markdown\nHere are my thoughts on the key issues to address and the practical next steps you suggest...\r\n\r\n## Why CLI vs IDE integration\r\n\r\nWell, I do think many of the innovations here need to exist across all our GitHub products. Explicit vs implicit context is a good example. Certainly the IDE and Project Padawan should have these abilities, in some form. \r\n\r\nLike \u0060git\u0060 and git capabilities, in the broadest sense, they exist in IDEs as extensions/gui integrations, like GitLens and others. There\u0027s even a full blown GitHub Desktop app. But, underneath all of that, they are based on either the CLI or the API. \r\n\r\nThere are many features exposed via the CLI that are not exposed in the IDE. For example, the CLI has a \u0060git stash\u0060 command, but the IDE does not. The IDE has a \u0022stash\u0022 button, but it doesn\u0027t expose all the features of \u0060git stash\u0060.\r\n\r\nPartly this is because the IDE is a GUI, and GUIs are not as flexible as CLIs. GUIs are also much more difficult to build and maintain. In addition, most GUIs aren\u0027t \u0022command oriented\u0022 like CLIs are. GUIs are more visual representation of the underlying data, and visual reinforcement of the capabilities. WYSIWYG. Both in data, and in the commands.\r\n\r\nWhereas, CLIs are more about the commands, and iterating on the commands. A set of shell interactions is a \u0022conversation\u0022 with and about the underlying data, using commands, either built-in to the shell, or custom via CLIs and shell scripts. \r\n\r\nThis underlying \u0022conversation\u0022 that CLIs are part of in the shell sessions (aka conversational flow) is a key part of the \u0022magic\u0022 of CLIs. It\u0027s also a key part of the \u0022magic\u0022 of the shell itself. The shell is a command interpreter, and the CLI is a command interpreter. The shell is a command line interface, and the CLI is a command line interface.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, I see the LLM boom as a new \u0022shell\u0022 for the \u0022commands\u0022 (via tool calling, and CLIs as tools).\r\n\r\n## Lack of Concrete Differentiation\r\n\r\nNot articulated well enough, yet, I believe the differentiation is a blending/blurring of the continuum of options between fully deterministic and fully non-deterministic. GenAI is in some sense the far end of the non-deterministic side of the continuum. CLIs (and command pattern apps and experiences in general) are the deterministic side of the continuum.\r\n\r\nIn Project Padawan, the users have very little deterministic control over the experience. They are at the mercy of the LLM, and the LLM is at the mercy of the data it was trained on. The LLM receives an issue to work on, or comments on the PR it produced, and it uses it\u0027s own \u0022intelligence\u0022 to produce or update the PR. The system is also nearly fully asynchronous, with large segments of time between user interactions with the LLMs outputs/results.\r\n\r\nWhereas, with GitHub Copilot as integrated into the IDE, there are a few deterministic controls, but not much. The user can attach a file, or multiple files, to the chat, or they can select ranges of code in the editor before invoking Copilot. Beyond that, there is little the user can do to \u0022input\u0022 or \u0022massage\u0022/\u0022iterate\u0022 on the context he/she wants to provide to the LLM. The user is still at the mercy of the LLM, and the LLM is still at the mercy of the data it was trained on. The system is highly synchronous, with the user and LLM working together in real-time, with almost no ability to infuse \u0022longer time\u0022 \u0022research\u0022 or \u0022exploration\u0022 or \u0022iteration\u0022 on the contextual input to the LLM. All the interactions withthe LLM are either linguistic, or small sized non-iterative code snippets, or full file references. \r\n\r\nThe differentiation I\u0027m proposing is in the \u0022Context slider\u0022 is the ability to operate at either end of the continuum, and to be able to \u0022slide\u0022 the context slider back and forth between the two ends. The user can opeate more like Project Padawan, and use almost no deterministic inputs, staying in the land of linguistic inputs, and the LLM will do all the work. Or, the user can operate more like a CLI, and use almost all deterministic inputs (searching for context via file globs, regular expressions, etc., pushing full files or contextual ranges (e.g. --contains \u0022auth|login|blah\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50)). They can also operate in a synchronous fashion, but with a bit more non-determinism, like a \u0022sidebar-use-of-LLM\u0022 to linguistically massage the outputs of their file-finding/code-block-finding via globs and regexes, to \u0022transform\u0022 the outputs to a certain way, then, injecting that into the primary LLM chat/task at hand. For example, \u0060--files **\\*.cs --contains \u0022public|protected\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50 --file-instructions \u0022find all public/protected methods in this file, output as a table, column 1 method name, column 2 parameters, column 3 return type, column 4 brief description\u0022\u0060 ... This hybrid semi-deterministic \u0022in-line\u0022 approach gives more control to the developer.\r\n\r\nThis blend of fully deterministic, fully non-deterministic, and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between them semi-deterministically, also allows for either \u0022in-line\u0022 (synchronous) injection of context sort of \u0022one-shot\u0022 or, using the CLI, you might use the CLI over and over again, conversationally, or with piping, or using input and output files, to find/filter/and massage the context you want to provide to the LLM. This then provides another slider on the sychronicity of the experience. The user can operate in a fully synchronous mode, or a fully asynchronous mode, or a hybrid of the two. \r\n\r\nTo do that effectively, the system needs to be designed more as a \u0022command oriented system\u0022, with \u0022pipelines\u0022 and \u0022memory/storage\u0022 (files, in memory variables, etc.) and \u0022commands\u0022 (be they CLIs, or slash commands in an input control). This doesn\u0027t require a CLI as an approach, but, CLIs inside shells are fundamentally designed in this fashion. \r\n\r\nOne final aspect to differentiation is the ability to output, input, and branch out, the chat-history of the conversation with the LLM. For example, I might use an interative approach to building up the context, and I want to then, \u0022check-point\u0022 the conversation, and store as a named \u0022conversation\u0022 (likely as a file on disk, stored in JSONL format of content/role messags to/from the LLM). I can then use that \u0022conversation\u0022 as a \u0022context\u0022 (starting point) for the next conversation, or I can use it as a \u0022branch point\u0022 to explore other branches of the conversation. This is similar to how Git works, and how GitHub works. The ability to branch out, and then merge back in, is a key part of the GitHub experience. Branching my interactions with the LLM at different \u0022save points\u0022 will allow developers to explore alternate conversational paths, both interactively, and programmatically.\r\n\r\nSo, summarizing my thoughts on the differentiation, I see it as a blend of:\r\n- Fully deterministic vs fully non-deterministic\r\n- Synchronous vs asynchronous\r\n- Command oriented vs GUI oriented\r\n- Context slider (and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between the two ends of the continuum)\r\n- Branching and merging of conversations\r\n- Checkpointing and saving of conversations\r\n\r\n## Feature Repetition Without Detail\r\n\r\nAgreed, there is too much repitition in the document. I want to fix that, and make the document both more streamlined, less repeitive, but also more detailed in the areas that are important.\r\n\r\nOn the repitition part about \u0022context exploration\u0022, I hope my dissertation above on the \u0022context slider\u0022 and the \u0022differentiation\u0022 between the two ends of the continuum, and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between them, will help you see what I\u0027m going for.\r\n\r\n## Integration Questions\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a good question about will this land inside \u0060gh\u0060 CLI as a sub-command, or as a separate CLI. There are a lot of implementation details here, for example, if the core of it is written in TypeScript like is Padawan, and the existing \u0060gh\u0060 CLI is written in Go, then it might be easier to build a new CLI. If the core of it is written in Go, then it might be easier to build it as a sub-command of \u0060gh\u0060.\r\n\r\nWe should probably call this out in the document, at least as a talking point/open question, if not a full section discussing what we need to do as next steps to figure this out.\r\n\r\n## Strategy Inconsistency\r\n\r\nI dont\u0027 think there\u0027s actually a strategy inconsistency, per se, as for GitHub Copilot in IDEs, it is certainly a \u0022multi-model-provider\u0022 messaging. Matt was talking about tthat for Project Padawan, the near term is a \u0022we\u0027ll pick the best provider\u0022, but ... certainly Microsoft\u0027s strategy all up is to provide model portability, and potentially even model provider portability. Both GitHub Model Marketplace and Azure AI Foundry both are about that. So, I think the strategy is consistent, but the messaging in this document is probably nt yet clear enough.\r\n\r\n## Multi-surface Strategy\r\n\r\nClearly, Microsoft/GitHub need a multi-surface strategy. We must \u0022meet the develoeprs where they are\u0022 ... That\u0027s across several fronts:\r\n- IDEs (VSCode, VS, JetBrains, IntelliJ, etc.)\r\n- Lightweight \u0022Vibe coding\u0022 experiences\r\n- Desktop, Mobile, and Web experiences\r\n- GUIs, Command oriented, and CLIs\r\n\r\n## Connecting to other DevDiv/GitHub Products\r\n\r\nSliding around as discussed above, also includes across the portfolio of products. For example, using the CLI to create/filter/iterate/massage context as input into any surface. Saving conversation history \u0022checkpoints\u0022 from any interaction in a consistent form, that can be used as continuation/branching points in any other surface. The ability to use /slash commands in any conversational surface to add determinism at different altitudes, like \u0060/files **/*.cs --contains \u0022...\u0022 --lines 3\u0060, in GitHub Copilot chat, in the interactive CLI experience, in IDE extensions for GH CP Chat, in GH issues when replying to a PR with comment for Project Padawan to address... literally anywhere... Much like we have \u0060@azure\u0060 extensibility points to invoke GH CP extensibility points, we should support similar \u0060/files ...\u0060 \u0060/websearch ...\u0060 and \u0060--(file|page)-instructions ...\u0060 and \u0060--instructinos ...\u0060 on each any /slash commands that make sense. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, we should have \u0022named\u0022 aliases for prompts, checkpoints, pipelines of /slash commands, etc... We should figure out how to \u0022share\u0022/\u0022sync\u0022/\u0022import/export\u0022 or whatever.\r\n\r\n## Superheros\r\n\r\nI hope the points above about operating \u0022in the middle\u0022 at \u0022any point\u0022 on the multi-dimensional continuum of determinism, synchronicity, and command-orientedness, will help you see the \u0022superheros\u0022 as being the \u0022context slider\u0022 and the \u0022branching/merging\u0022 of conversations.\r\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## ghcp\\github-cli-spec-reboot-direction.md\n\nModified: 32 minutes ago\nSize: 10 KB\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060markdown\n\u003E [THINKING]\r\n\u003E # Rethinking My Approach Based on Your Feedback\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Your detailed response gives me much more clarity on what you\u0027re trying to achieve with this document. Let me reconsider my recommendations based on your feedback:\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ## Core Insights from Your Response\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 1. **The Core Innovation is the \u0022Context Slider\u0022**: You\u0027re proposing a fundamentally new paradigm that spans the continuum between fully deterministic (CLI-style) and fully non-deterministic (GenAI) approaches. This \u0022slider\u0022 allows developers to precisely control where on this spectrum they want to operate for any given task.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 2. **Multiplicity of Dimensions**: This isn\u0027t just about determinism, but multiple axes:\r\n\u003E    - Deterministic vs. non-deterministic\r\n\u003E    - Synchronous vs. asynchronous\r\n\u003E    - One-shot context vs. iterative context refinement\r\n\u003E    - Command-oriented vs. conversation-oriented\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 3. **Conversation Management as a First-Class Concept**: The ability to checkpoint, branch, and merge conversations is a powerful Git-like metaphor that hasn\u0027t been well-articulated in the document.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 4. **CLI as a Natural First Implementation**: While these capabilities should eventually span the entire GitHub product suite, the CLI/terminal environment is a natural first implementation because:\r\n\u003E    - Terminal sessions are already structured around command sequences\r\n\u003E    - CLIs naturally support command composability and piping\r\n\u003E    - The shell environment already has the concept of state persistence\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 5. **Platform-Level Innovation**: This isn\u0027t just a product but a platform-level capability that should eventually be exposed across all GitHub surfaces.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ## New Recommended Approach\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Based on these insights, here\u0027s my revised recommendation for restructuring the document:\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ### 1. Lead with the \u0022Context Slider\u0022 Paradigm\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Start by articulating this new paradigm clearly - not as a feature but as a fundamental rethinking of how developers can interact with AI. This should be positioned as GitHub\u0027s unique innovation in the AI development space.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ### 2. Frame the CLI as the \u0022Reference Implementation\u0022\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Rather than positioning this primarily as a CLI product competing with Claude Code, frame it as a new AI interaction paradigm whose first and most complete implementation will be in the terminal environment. Explain why the terminal is the natural first home for this approach (command composability, state management, etc.).\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ### 3. Present a Clear Roadmap for Cross-Product Implementation\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Show how this paradigm will eventually extend across all GitHub surfaces, with each surface implementing the capabilities in ways that make sense for that environment. For example:\r\n\u003E - Terminal: Full command syntax\r\n\u003E - IDE: Slash commands in chat \u002B UI affordances\r\n\u003E - GitHub web: Integrated context tools in PR/issue interfaces\r\n\u003E - Lightweight experiences: Simplified command builders\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ### 4. Provide Detailed Examples of the Context Slider in Action\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Use concrete examples to show how developers can:\r\n\u003E - Start with fully deterministic context gathering\r\n\u003E - Add linguistic elements to refine that context\r\n\u003E - Gradually shift to more AI-driven exploration\r\n\u003E - Checkpoint and branch their explorations\r\n\u003E All within a single workflow.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ### 5. Clearly Articulate the Platform Architecture\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Explain the underlying architecture that will allow these capabilities to be shared across products:\r\n\u003E - Consistent command surface\r\n\u003E - Shared context management\r\n\u003E - Cross-product conversation persistence\r\n\u003E - Common extension points\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ### 6. Position Against Competitors as a Paradigm Shift\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Rather than competing feature-by-feature with Claude Code, position this as a fundamentally different approach to AI assistance - one that gives developers a completely new kind of control over their AI interactions.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E ## Specific Document Structure Recommendations\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 1. **Title**: \u0022GitHub Copilot Command: The Next Generation of Developer-Controlled AI Assistance\u0022\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 2. **Executive Summary**: Lead with the paradigm shift - the \u0022Context Slider\u0022 that allows developers to work anywhere on the continuum from fully deterministic to fully AI-driven, with the ability to branch and merge conversational explorations.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 3. **The Context Slider Paradigm**: Detailed explanation of this new approach to AI interaction, with concrete examples.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 4. **Why Terminal First**: Explanation of why the terminal environment is the natural first implementation of this paradigm (command orientation, composability, state management).\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 5. **Cross-Product Vision**: How this paradigm will extend across all GitHub products, with specific examples for each surface.       \r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 6. **Platform Architecture**: The underlying components that will enable this cross-product implementation.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 7. **Competitive Differentiation**: How this paradigm fundamentally differentiates from other approaches in the market.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E 8. **Implementation Roadmap**: Starting with the CLI but extending across the product suite over time.\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E This approach addresses the stakeholder comments by:\r\n\u003E 1. Clearly explaining why terminal is the first implementation but not the only one\r\n\u003E 2. Providing concrete details on the unique innovations\r\n\u003E 3. Showing how this connects to the broader GitHub ecosystem\r\n\u003E 4. Presenting a coherent cross-product strategy\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E It also retains the most compelling aspects of your original vision while addressing the legitimate concerns raised in the comments.  \r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E Thought logged.\r\n\r\nAssistant: After digesting your comprehensive thoughts, I see a much clearer vision for what you\u0027re trying to achieve. Let me revise my approach based on this deeper understanding:\r\n\r\n# Revised Recommendations for Document Restructuring\r\n\r\n## 1. Reframe Around the \u0022Context Slider\u0022 Paradigm, Not Just a CLI Product\r\n\r\nYour core innovation is the multi-dimensional \u0022Context Slider\u0022 - a revolutionary approach allowing developers to operate anywhere along multiple continua:\r\n- Deterministic \u2194 Non-deterministic context building\r\n- Synchronous \u2194 Asynchronous interaction\r\n- Command-oriented \u2194 Conversation-oriented workflows\r\n- Explicit \u2194 Implicit context gathering\r\n\r\nThis paradigm shift deserves to be the centerpiece of the document, with the CLI positioned as its natural first implementation, not merely as a competitive product to Claude Code.\r\n\r\n## 2. Position the CLI as the Reference Implementation, Not the End Goal\r\n\r\nThe terminal environment is the ideal first implementation because:\r\n- It naturally supports command composition and pipelining\r\n- Shell sessions are already built around command sequences and state manipulation\r\n- It offers the richest environment for the full expression of the Context Slider paradigm\r\n- The command-oriented nature of shells aligns perfectly with explicit context building\r\n\r\nRather than defending \u0022why CLI instead of IDE,\u0022 position it as \u0022CLI first, then everywhere\u0022 - with the CLI serving as the reference implementation of capabilities that will eventually extend across all surfaces.\r\n\r\n## 3. Articulate the Git-like Conversation Management System\r\n\r\nThe ability to checkpoint, branch, and merge conversational explorations is a uniquely powerful concept that deserves much more prominence. This Git-like metaphor for AI interactions would be transformative for long-running development projects and team collaboration.\r\n\r\nCreate a dedicated section explaining this system with concrete examples showing how developers can:\r\n- Save conversational checkpoints at critical decision points\r\n- Branch to explore alternative approaches\r\n- Merge insights from different exploration paths\r\n- Share these conversational branches with team members\r\n\r\n## 4. Create Detailed Examples of Cross-Dimensional Workflows\r\n\r\nShow how a developer might:\r\n1. Start with highly deterministic context gathering (\u0060--files \u0022**/*.auth.js\u0022 --contains \u0022login|authenticate\u0022\u0060)\r\n2. Apply linguistic refinement to that context (\u0060--file-instructions \u0022Extract the authentication flow\u0022\u0060)\r\n3. Inject that refined context into a broader conversational task\r\n4. Branch the conversation to explore alternative solutions\r\n5.

This innovation allows developers to fluidly move between explicit, developer-controlled context building and implicit, AI-driven exploration\u2014all while maintaining the ability to checkpoint, branch, and merge their AI conversations like code in a Git repository.\\n\\nThis document outlines our vision for GitHub Copilot Continuum as a comprehensive platform that spans all development surfaces. While the terminal provides the natural first implementation for this paradigm, the capabilities will extend across IDEs, GitHub.com, and standalone experiences, creating a cohesive ecosystem where developers maintain complete control over their AI interactions.\\n\\nBy implementing the Context Slider paradigm, GitHub will establish a uniquely powerful position in the AI development landscape\u2014one that respects developer agency, amplifies developer capabilities, and ultimately delivers on the promise of AI as a true coding partner rather than just a suggestion engine or autonomous agent.\\n\\n## The Multi-Dimensional Context Slider: A New Paradigm\\n\\n### Beyond Binary Choices: The Continuum of AI Interaction\\n\\nCurrent AI coding assistants force developers into binary choices:\\n- **GitHub Copilot in IDEs**: Primarily suggestion-driven with limited context control through file attachments\\n- **Project Padawan**: Fully autonomous with minimal developer guidance\\n- **Competitors like Claude Code**: Automated context gathering with limited developer control\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Continuum introduces a fundamentally new approach: the **Context Slider**. Rather than forcing developers to choose between deterministic control and AI autonomy, the Context Slider allows fluid movement along multiple dimensions:\\n\\n1. **Deterministic \u2194 Non-deterministic context building**\\n   - Control exactly what context the AI sees through explicit commands\\n   - Let the AI autonomously explore relevant context\\n   - Or operate anywhere in between with guided exploration\\n\\n2. **Synchronous \u2194 Asynchronous interaction**\\n   - Work interactively in real-time for immediate feedback\\n   - Set up longer-running context exploration tasks\\n   - Combine both approaches within a single workflow\\n\\n3. **Command-oriented \u2194 Conversation-oriented workflows**\\n   - Use precise commands for explicit control\\n   - Engage in natural language dialogue\\n   - Seamlessly blend commands and conversation\\n\\n4. **Explicit \u2194 Implicit context gathering**\\n   - Manually curate exactly which files, functions, and code snippets are relevant\\n   - Allow the AI to determine what context is needed\\n   - Guide the AI with high-level directives while letting it handle the details\\n\\n### The Power of Developer-Controlled Context\\n\\nAt the heart of the Context Slider is a revolutionary approach to context gathering\u2014empowering developers with unprecedented control over what information the AI considers when responding to requests.\\n\\n#### Example: From Fully Deterministic to AI-Guided\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\n# Fully deterministic context gathering\\ngithub-copilot --files \\\u0022**/*.auth.js\\\u0022 --contains \\\u0022login|authenticate\\\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50 \\\\\\n  --instructions \\\u0022Help me understand the authentication flow\\\u0022\\n\\n# Add linguistic refinement to deterministic context\\ngithub-copilot --files \\\u0022**/*.auth.js\\\u0022 --contains \\\u0022login|authenticate\\\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50 \\\\\\n  --file-instructions \\\u0022Extract the essential parts of the authentication flow and create a sequence diagram\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --instructions \\\u0022Explain potential security vulnerabilities in this authentication implementation\\\u0022\\n\\n# Semi-deterministic with guided AI exploration\\ngithub-copilot --find-auth-files --instructions \\\u0022Find potential security vulnerabilities in our authentication system\\\u0022\\n\\n# Fully conversation-driven but with developer guidance\\ngithub-copilot \\\u0022Analyze our authentication system for security vulnerabilities, focusing particularly on JWT implementation and session management\\\u0022\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nThis approach puts developers firmly in control of the exploration process, allowing them to explicitly guide the AI\u0027s focus while still leveraging its analytical capabilities.\\n\\n### The Revolutionary Impact of the Context Slider\\n\\nThe Context Slider transforms AI-assisted development by:\\n\\n1. **Eliminating the \\\u0022garbage in, garbage out\\\u0022 problem** - Developers can precisely curate the context to ensure relevant information\\n   \\n2. **Reducing token usage and costs** - Explicit context selection avoids wasting tokens on irrelevant information\\n\\n3. **Preserving developer agency** - Developers control exactly how much they want to drive versus delegate\\n\\n4. **Enabling progressive exploration** - Start targeted and expand context methodically as understanding grows\\n\\n5. **Supporting diverse workflows** - Adapt the interaction style to match the specific task and developer preference\\n\\n## Conversation Management: Git for AI Interactions\\n\\nA revolutionary aspect of GitHub Copilot Continuum is its approach to managing AI conversations over time: **Conversational Version Control**.\\n\\n### Checkpoint, Branch, and Merge AI Explorations\\n\\nJust as Git transformed how developers manage code, Conversational Version Control transforms how developers manage AI interactions:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\n# Start a conversation and save it for later\\ngithub-copilot \\\u0022Let\u0027s design a new authentication system using OAuth 2.0\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --output-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/initial-design.jsonl\\\u0022\\n\\n# Continue the conversation with preserved context\\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/initial-design.jsonl\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --output-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/implementation-planning.jsonl\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --instructions \\\u0022Now let\u0027s plan the implementation details for our OAuth 2.0 system\\\u0022\\n\\n# Create a branch to explore an alternative approach\\ngithub-copilot --input-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/implementation-planning.jsonl\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --output-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/alternative-jwt-approach.jsonl\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --instructions \\\u0022Let\u0027s explore an alternative implementation using JWTs instead\\\u0022\\n\\n# Compare insights from both branches\\ngithub-copilot \\\\\\n  --input-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/oauth-implementation.jsonl\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --input-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/alternative-jwt-approach.jsonl\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --instructions \\\u0022Compare these two approaches and create a hybrid solution that takes the best elements from both\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --output-chat-history \\\u0022projects/auth-system/hybrid-solution.jsonl\\\u0022\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nThis capability enables entirely new workflows:\\n\\n1. **Long-term explorations** - Maintain context across days or weeks of development\\n2. **Parallel solution paths** - Explore multiple approaches without losing context\\n3. **Team collaboration** - Share conversation checkpoints with team members\\n4. **Knowledge retention** - Build a library of conversational explorations that capture decision-making process\\n5. **Token optimization** - Trim conversation history to focus on the most relevant parts while preserving key insights\\n\\n### Transforming Team Collaboration\\n\\nConversational Version Control transforms team collaboration by enabling:\\n\\n- **Shared context** - Team members can build on each other\u0027s explorations\\n- **Traceable decision making** - The rationale behind design choices is preserved in conversation history\\n- **Knowledge transfer** - New team members can review conversation history to understand project evolution\\n- **Exploration reuse** - Common exploration patterns can be saved as templates for future use\\n\\n## Why Terminal First: The Natural Home for Context Control\\n\\nWhile the Context Slider paradigm will ultimately extend across all GitHub surfaces, the terminal environment provides the natural first implementation for several critical reasons:\\n\\n### The Terminal\u0027s Command-Oriented Nature\\n\\nTerminal environments are inherently built around the command pattern, making them the ideal starting point for explicit context control:\\n\\n1. **Command composability** - Terminal commands naturally support piping and composition\\n2. **Parameter flexibility** - Terminal commands can support rich parameter sets for fine-grained control\\n3. **Script integration** - Terminal commands can be easily incorporated into automation scripts\\n4. **State persistence** - Terminal sessions already manage state across command invocations\\n5. **Explicit intent** - Terminal commands require explicit invocation, aligning with the developer-in-control philosophy\\n\\n### The Terminal Renaissance\\n\\nThere is substantial evidence of a \\\u0022terminal renaissance\\\u0022 in modern development:\\n\\n1. **Investment signals** - Major funding for terminal-focused tools like Warp Terminal\\n2. **Developer adoption** - JetBrains reports 92% of developers use the terminal at least weekly\\n3. **Tool explosion** - Modern CLI tools like Ripgrep and FZF seeing massive adoption\\n4. **DevOps movement** - Infrastructure-as-code and GitOps driving terminal proficiency\\n5. **Terminal evolution** - Modern terminals now supporting rich content and GPU acceleration\\n\\n### Addressing the Full Spectrum of Developer Needs\\n\\nThe terminal implementation provides:\\n\\n1. **Windows excellence** - Native Windows support through deep integration with Windows Terminal and PowerShell\\n2. **Speed and efficiency** - Terminal interfaces minimize UI overhead for experienced developers\\n3. **Remote workflow support** - Terminal commands work seamlessly in remote development scenarios\\n4. **Integration with existing tools** - Terminal commands can complement existing CLI workflow tools\\n5. **Cross-IDE compatibility** - Terminal-based tools work across all development environments\\n\\n## Platform Architecture and Cross-Product Strategy\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Continuum is not just a product but a platform-level capability that will extend across the entire GitHub ecosystem.\\n\\n### Core Components of the Platform\\n\\n1. **Command Surface API** - A consistent command interface that can be exposed across all surfaces\\n2. **Context Management Layer** - Standardized methods for gathering, refining, and applying context\\n3. **Conversation Persistence Protocol** - Common format for saving, loading, and branching conversations\\n4. **Model Provider Abstraction** - Flexible switching between AI providers based on task requirements\\n5. **Extension Framework** - Support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable third-party integrations\\n\\n### Implementation Across Surfaces\\n\\nEach GitHub surface will implement the Context Slider paradigm in ways that are natural for that environment:\\n\\n#### Terminal Implementation (First Release)\\n\\nThe most complete implementation, exposing the full power of the command surface and context management capabilities through a rich CLI interface.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\n# Example of complex context gathering in the terminal\\ngithub-copilot --files \\\u0022**/*.auth.js\\\u0022 --contains \\\u0022login|authenticate\\\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50 \\\\\\n  --file-instructions \\\u0022Extract the essential parts of the authentication flow and create a sequence diagram\\\u0022 \\\\\\n  --web-search \\\u0022oauth 2.0 best practices 2024\\\u0022 --max-results 3 \\\\\\n  --instructions \\\u0022Compare our implementation with current best practices\\\u0022\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### IDE Integration\\n\\nIDE implementations will blend GUI affordances with command capabilities:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n# Example of slash commands in VS Code Copilot Chat\\n/files \\\u0022**/*.auth.js\\\u0022 --contains \\\u0022login|authenticate\\\u0022\\nHow does our authentication flow compare to OAuth 2.0 best practices?\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nWith additional UI elements for:\\n- Visual context selection\\n- Context visualization\\n- Conversation branching UI\\n\\n#### GitHub.com Integration\\n\\nGitHub.com will integrate context-aware capabilities into PR and issue workflows:\\n\\n- Context-aware suggestions in PR reviews\\n- Enhanced Copilot capabilities in issue comments\\n- Context preservation across GitHub interactions\\n- Integration with Project Padawan for more guided autonomous work\\n\\n#### Standalone Experiences\\n\\nSimplified interfaces for \\\u0022Vibe coders\\\u0022 and casual users:\\n- Visual command builders\\n- Templated exploration patterns\\n- Guided context gathering wizards\\n\\n### Cross-Surface Consistency\\n\\nA developer\u0027s context and conversations will follow them across surfaces:\\n- Start an exploration in the terminal\\n- Continue in VS Code\\n- Share with a team member who might use JetBrains\\n- Reference in a GitHub issue for Project Padawan\\n\\n## Competitive Differentiation: A New Category\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Continuum creates an entirely new category of AI development assistance that transcends the limitations of both current IDE integrations and terminal-based competitors.\\n\\n### Comparison to Claude Code and Other Terminal Assistants\\n\\n| Capability | GitHub Copilot Continuum | Claude Code | Other Terminal Tools |\\n|------------|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------|\\n| Context Control | Full context slider from deterministic to AI-guided | Primarily AI-driven with limited user control | Varies, but typically limited to manual file selection |\\n| Conversation Management | Git-like checkpoint, branch, and merge | Limited session persistence | Typically single-session only |\\n| Model Flexibility | Just-in-time model selection | Single model provider | Varies, some support multiple models |\\n| Platform Reach | Terminal first, then all surfaces | Terminal only | Terminal only |\\n| GitHub Integration | Deep native integration | Limited or bolt-on | Typically minimal |\\n| Windows Support | Native excellence | Requires WSL | Varies, often limited |\\n| Extension Framework | Model Context Protocol support | Limited extensibility | Typically closed ecosystems |\\n\\n### Beyond Feature Comparisons: A Paradigm Shift\\n\\nThe true differentiation goes beyond feature comparison:\\n\\n1. **Developer Agency vs. AI Autonomy** - Competitors force a choice, GitHub Copilot Continuum offers a continuum\\n2. **Conversation as an Asset** - Only GitHub Copilot Continuum treats conversations as versioned assets\\n3. **Cross-Surface Coherence** - Only GitHub can deliver a truly integrated experience across all development surfaces\\n4. **Progressive Context Refinement** - The ability to iteratively build and refine context is unique to GitHub Copilot Continuum\\n\\n## Implementation Considerations and Roadmap\\n\\n### Relationship to Existing Tools\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Continuum will be implemented as:\\n\\n1. **Terminal**: A new \u0060github-copilot\u0060 CLI that complements the existing \u0060gh\u0060 CLI\\n2. **IDE**: Extensions to GitHub Copilot in VS Code and other IDEs\\n3. **GitHub.com**: Enhanced capabilities

with PR and issue workflows\\n4. **Phase 4**: Standalone experiences for specific audiences\\n\\n### Open Questions and Decisions\\n\\nSeveral key decisions require further exploration:\\n\\n1. **Implementation language** for the CLI (Go vs. TypeScript)\\n2. **Standardization approach** for conversation persistence format\\n3. **Authentication and permissions model** across surfaces\\n4. **Pricing and bundling strategy** within the GitHub Copilot portfolio\\n5. **Extension marketplace approach** for third-party tools\\n\\n## User Scenarios: The Context Slider in Action\\n\\n### Scenario 1: The Enterprise Architect Exploring a Microservice Architecture\\n\\nAn enterprise architect needs to understand a complex microservice architecture with dozens of services before planning a refactoring strategy.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\n# Step 1: Find and analyze all service definitions across the codebase\\ngithub-copilot --files \\\u0022**/*Service.{js,ts}\\\u0022 \\\\\\n

\\\u0022exploration/alternative-refactoring-strategy.md\\\u0022\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nThis approach allows the architect to systematically explore the codebase in a way that aligns with how experienced architects think, progressively building understanding and leaving behind artifacts that can be shared with the team.\\n\\n### Scenario 2: The Senior Developer Researching a Security Vulnerability\\n\\nA security audit across multiple services can be methodically approached using the Context Slider paradigm:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\n# Step 1: Find all authentication and

comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.\\n\\n### Scenario 3: Learning a New Framework through Web Research and Codebase Exploration\\n\\nBy integrating web search commands with codebase exploration, GitHub Copilot Continuum helps developers learn new frameworks:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\n# Step 1: Research Next.js best practices from the web\\ngithub-copilot web search

web research with codebase exploration, allowing the developer to learn framework concepts while understanding their practical application in the existing codebase.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Completing the AI Development Triad\\n\\nGitHub Copilot Continuum completes GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy by filling the critical middle ground between GitHub Copilot in IDEs and Project Padawan:\\n\\n1. **GitHub Copilot in IDEs**: Deeply embedded assistance where developers write code, offering suggestions, chat, and agent capabilities within the development environment.\\n\\n2. **Project Padawan**: Autonomous issue and PR handling that works independently on GitHub tasks, treating the AI as another team member.\\n\\n3. **GitHub Copilot Continuum**: The crucial middle ground that empowers developers to be \\\u0022superheroes\\\u0022 in their own journey, controlling precisely how they leverage AI through the Context Slider paradigm.\\n\\nThis three-pillar approach creates a complete spectrum of AI assistance, from highly interactive to fully autonomous, allowing developers to choose the right approach for each task.\\n\\nBy implementing the Context Slider paradigm across all surfaces, GitHub will create an unparalleled AI-assisted development ecosystem\u2014one that respects developer agency, amplifies developer capabilities, and ultimately delivers on the promise of AI as a true coding partner rather than just a suggestion engine or autonomous agent.\\n\\nThe future of development is not about choosing between developer control and AI

While the concept has significant merit and addresses a clear market opportunity, there are several areas that require further development before this can be considered a fully formed strategic proposal.\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Novel Conceptual Framework**: The \\\u0022Context Slider\\\u0022 paradigm is genuinely innovative and addresses a critical gap in the current AI development landscape. The multi-dimensional approach to control across deterministic/non-deterministic, synchronous/asynchronous, etc. shows deep thinking about developer needs.\\n\\n2. **Conversation Management Vision**: The Git-like metaphor for AI conversation management has significant potential to transform how developers work with AI over time. This could be a genuine game-changer if executed well.\\n\\n3. **Terminal-First Approach**: The justification for starting with a terminal implementation is logical and well-argued, particularly given the \\\u0022terminal renaissance\\\u0022 data.\\n\\n4. **Comprehensive Ecosystem Vision**: The proposal correctly positions this as an ecosystem play rather than a single product, which aligns with our broader platform strategy.\\n\\n## Areas Requiring Additional Work\\n\\n### 1. Business Strategy \u0026 Go-to-Market\\n\\nThe proposal lacks concrete discussion of:\\n- Revenue model and pricing strategy\\n- Target customer segments and adoption projections\\n- Marketing positioning relative to our existing Copilot offerings\\n- Competitive response strategies\\n- Investment requirements and expected ROI\\n\\n**Key Question**: How does this fit into our overall Copilot monetization strategy? Is this a premium offering, part of existing tiers, or something else?\\n\\n### 2. Technical Feasibility Assessment\\n\\nWhile the examples are compelling, several aspects need deeper technical validation:\\n- Performance implications of the pattern-based file searching at scale\\n- Token consumption modeling and cost implications\\n- Implementation architecture and cross-surface consistency challenges\\n- Data security implications for conversation persistence\\n\\n**Key Question**: Have we validated that these patterns can be implemented with acceptable performance at enterprise scale?\\n\\n### 3. User Adoption Strategy\\n\\nThe document assumes developer enthusiasm but doesn\u0027t address:\\n- Learning curve concerns for the command syntax\\n- Migration path for current Copilot users\\n- Onboarding strategy to help developers adopt this paradigm\\n- Research validating that developers want this level of control\\n\\n**Key Question**: How do we ensure this doesn\u0027t become too complex for mainstream developer adoption?\\n\\n### 4. Prioritization and Resource Allocation\\n\\nThe document doesn\u0027t address:\\n- Team composition and size requirements\\n- Timeline with key milestones\\n- Dependencies on other teams/products\\n- Critical path items that could block progress\\n\\n**Key Question**: What would be the scope of a minimally viable first release, and what resources would it require?\\n\\n### 5. Integration with Existing Products\\n\\nWhile the document mentions cross-product implementation, it needs more detail on:\\n- Specific integration points with GitHub Copilot in IDEs\\n- Coordination with Project Padawan team on shared capabilities\\n- Collaboration with the GitHub CLI team\\n- Management of potential feature overlap and confusion\\n\\n**Key Question**: How do we ensure consistent experiences across surfaces without duplicating efforts?\\n\\n## Strategic Concerns\\n\\n### 1. Risk of Over-Complexity\\n\\nThe breadth of the vision creates a risk of developing a product that\u0027s powerful but too complex for mainstream adoption. The command syntax shown in examples, while powerful, could intimidate many developers. A clearer strategy for progressive disclosure of complexity is needed.\\n\\n### 2. Market Timing Considerations\\n\\nWhile the document makes a case for \\\u0022why now,\\\u0022 it doesn\u0027t fully address:\\n- How rapidly competitors could replicate these capabilities\\n- Whether developers are ready for this paradigm shift\\n- How this fits with the evolution of AI capabilities over the next 12-24 months\\n\\n### 3. Differentiation Sustainability\\n\\nThe document makes a compelling case for differentiation today, but doesn\u0027t adequately address:\\n- How sustainable this differentiation will be as AI capabilities evolve\\n- What barriers to entry would prevent competitors from copying the approach\\n- How we maintain leadership as the market evolves\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Develop Business Case**: Create a concrete business plan with pricing, market sizing, and revenue projections.\\n\\n2. **Conduct User Research**: Validate the core paradigm with a broader set of developers before committing significant resources.\\n\\n3. **Technical Prototype**: Build a minimal prototype to validate key technical assumptions about performance and feasibility.\\n\\n4. **Phased Approach**: Define a more granular phased approach with specific deliverables for each phase.\\n\\n5. **Cross-Team Alignment**: Ensure alignment with GitHub Copilot, GitHub CLI, and Project Padawan teams on shared vision and responsibilities.\\n\\n6. **Simplification**: Consider how the complex command syntax could be made more approachable through progressive disclosure, templates, or UI affordances.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe GitHub Copilot Continuum proposal presents a bold and innovative vision with significant potential to transform AI-assisted development. The core concepts\u2014particularly the Context Slider paradigm and conversation management capabilities\u2014represent genuinely novel thinking in this space.\\n\\nHowever, before moving forward with significant investment, we need to develop a more concrete business strategy, validate technical feasibility, and ensure we have a clear path to mainstream developer adoption. With these elements in place, this could represent a significant strategic advantage for GitHub in the AI development space.\\n\\nI recommend approving continued exploration of this concept with a small team focused on addressing the gaps identified above, with a decision point for full investment once these questions are answered.\u0022, \u0022path\u0022: \u0022ghcp/github-copilot-continuum-9-critique.md\u0022}"},"type":"function"}]}

{"role":"assistant","content":"I\u0027ve created both requested documents:\n\n1. The main proposal document (\u0060ghcp/github-copilot-continuum-9.md\u0060) that reframes the GitHub Copilot CLI concept around the \u0022Context Slider\u0022 paradigm, positioning it as a revolutionary approach to AI interaction that spans the continuum from deterministic to autonomous, with the terminal as its natural first implementation.\n\n2. A VP-level critique (\u0060ghcp/github-copilot-continuum-9-critique.md\u0060) that acknowledges the innovative vision while highlighting several areas that require additional development before it becomes a fully formed strategic proposal - particularly around business strategy, technical feasibility, user adoption, resource allocation, and integration with existing products.\n\nThe main document implements the restructuring approach you suggested, focusing on the multi-dimensional nature of the Context Slider paradigm and the revolutionary Conversation Management capabilities, while the critique provides a balanced assessment from a senior leadership perspective."}
