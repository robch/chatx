Here are my thoughts on the key issues to address and the practical next steps you suggest...

## Why CLI vs IDE integration

Well, I do think many of the innovations here need to exist across all our GitHub products. Explicit vs implicit context is a good example. Certainly the IDE and Project Padawan should have these abilities, in some form. 

Like `git` and git capabilities, in the broadest sense, they exist in IDEs as extensions/gui integrations, like GitLens and others. There's even a full blown GitHub Desktop app. But, underneath all of that, they are based on either the CLI or the API. 

There are many features exposed via the CLI that are not exposed in the IDE. For example, the CLI has a `git stash` command, but the IDE does not. The IDE has a "stash" button, but it doesn't expose all the features of `git stash`.

Partly this is because the IDE is a GUI, and GUIs are not as flexible as CLIs. GUIs are also much more difficult to build and maintain. In addition, most GUIs aren't "command oriented" like CLIs are. GUIs are more visual representation of the underlying data, and visual reinforcement of the capabilities. WYSIWYG. Both in data, and in the commands.

Whereas, CLIs are more about the commands, and iterating on the commands. A set of shell interactions is a "conversation" with and about the underlying data, using commands, either built-in to the shell, or custom via CLIs and shell scripts. 

This underlying "conversation" that CLIs are part of in the shell sessions (aka conversational flow) is a key part of the "magic" of CLIs. It's also a key part of the "magic" of the shell itself. The shell is a command interpreter, and the CLI is a command interpreter. The shell is a command line interface, and the CLI is a command line interface.

In many ways, I see the LLM boom as a new "shell" for the "commands" (via tool calling, and CLIs as tools).

## Lack of Concrete Differentiation

Not articulated well enough, yet, I believe the differentiation is a blending/blurring of the continuum of options between fully deterministic and fully non-deterministic. GenAI is in some sense the far end of the non-deterministic side of the continuum. CLIs (and command pattern apps and experiences in general) are the deterministic side of the continuum.

In Project Padawan, the users have very little deterministic control over the experience. They are at the mercy of the LLM, and the LLM is at the mercy of the data it was trained on. The LLM receives an issue to work on, or comments on the PR it produced, and it uses it's own "intelligence" to produce or update the PR. The system is also nearly fully asynchronous, with large segments of time between user interactions with the LLMs outputs/results.

Whereas, with GitHub Copilot as integrated into the IDE, there are a few deterministic controls, but not much. The user can attach a file, or multiple files, to the chat, or they can select ranges of code in the editor before invoking Copilot. Beyond that, there is little the user can do to "input" or "massage"/"iterate" on the context he/she wants to provide to the LLM. The user is still at the mercy of the LLM, and the LLM is still at the mercy of the data it was trained on. The system is highly synchronous, with the user and LLM working together in real-time, with almost no ability to infuse "longer time" "research" or "exploration" or "iteration" on the contextual input to the LLM. All the interactions withthe LLM are either linguistic, or small sized non-iterative code snippets, or full file references. 

The differentiation I'm proposing is in the "Context slider" is the ability to operate at either end of the continuum, and to be able to "slide" the context slider back and forth between the two ends. The user can opeate more like Project Padawan, and use almost no deterministic inputs, staying in the land of linguistic inputs, and the LLM will do all the work. Or, the user can operate more like a CLI, and use almost all deterministic inputs (searching for context via file globs, regular expressions, etc., pushing full files or contextual ranges (e.g. --contains "auth|login|blah" --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50)). They can also operate in a synchronous fashion, but with a bit more non-determinism, like a "sidebar-use-of-LLM" to linguistically massage the outputs of their file-finding/code-block-finding via globs and regexes, to "transform" the outputs to a certain way, then, injecting that into the primary LLM chat/task at hand. For example, `--files **\*.cs --contains "public|protected" --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50 --file-instructions "find all public/protected methods in this file, output as a table, column 1 method name, column 2 parameters, column 3 return type, column 4 brief description"` ... This hybrid semi-deterministic "in-line" approach gives more control to the developer.

This blend of fully deterministic, fully non-deterministic, and the ability to "slide" between them semi-deterministically, also allows for either "in-line" (synchronous) injection of context sort of "one-shot" or, using the CLI, you might use the CLI over and over again, conversationally, or with piping, or using input and output files, to find/filter/and massage the context you want to provide to the LLM. This then provides another slider on the sychronicity of the experience. The user can operate in a fully synchronous mode, or a fully asynchronous mode, or a hybrid of the two. 

To do that effectively, the system needs to be designed more as a "command oriented system", with "pipelines" and "memory/storage" (files, in memory variables, etc.) and "commands" (be they CLIs, or slash commands in an input control). This doesn't require a CLI as an approach, but, CLIs inside shells are fundamentally designed in this fashion. 

One final aspect to differentiation is the ability to output, input, and branch out, the chat-history of the conversation with the LLM. For example, I might use an interative approach to building up the context, and I want to then, "check-point" the conversation, and store as a named "conversation" (likely as a file on disk, stored in JSONL format of content/role messags to/from the LLM). I can then use that "conversation" as a "context" (starting point) for the next conversation, or I can use it as a "branch point" to explore other branches of the conversation. This is similar to how Git works, and how GitHub works. The ability to branch out, and then merge back in, is a key part of the GitHub experience. Branching my interactions with the LLM at different "save points" will allow developers to explore alternate conversational paths, both interactively, and programmatically.

So, summarizing my thoughts on the differentiation, I see it as a blend of:
- Fully deterministic vs fully non-deterministic
- Synchronous vs asynchronous
- Command oriented vs GUI oriented
- Context slider (and the ability to "slide" between the two ends of the continuum)
- Branching and merging of conversations
- Checkpointing and saving of conversations

## Feature Repetition Without Detail

Agreed, there is too much repitition in the document. I want to fix that, and make the document both more streamlined, less repeitive, but also more detailed in the areas that are important.

On the repitition part about "context exploration", I hope my dissertation above on the "context slider" and the "differentiation" between the two ends of the continuum, and the ability to "slide" between them, will help you see what I'm going for.

## Integration Questions

It's a good question about will this land inside `gh` CLI as a sub-command, or as a separate CLI. There are a lot of implementation details here, for example, if the core of it is written in TypeScript like is Padawan, and the existing `gh` CLI is written in Go, then it might be easier to build a new CLI. If the core of it is written in Go, then it might be easier to build it as a sub-command of `gh`.

We should probably call this out in the document, at least as a talking point/open question, if not a full section discussing what we need to do as next steps to figure this out.

## Strategy Inconsistency

I dont' think there's actually a strategy inconsistency, per se, as for GitHub Copilot in IDEs, it is certainly a "multi-model-provider" messaging. Matt was talking about tthat for Project Padawan, the near term is a "we'll pick the best provider", but ... certainly Microsoft's strategy all up is to provide model portability, and potentially even model provider portability. Both GitHub Model Marketplace and Azure AI Foundry both are about that. So, I think the strategy is consistent, but the messaging in this document is probably nt yet clear enough.

## Multi-surface Strategy

Clearly, Microsoft/GitHub need a multi-surface strategy. We must "meet the develoeprs where they are" ... That's across several fronts:
- IDEs (VSCode, VS, JetBrains, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Lightweight "Vibe coding" experiences
- Desktop, Mobile, and Web experiences
- GUIs, Command oriented, and CLIs

## Connecting to other DevDiv/GitHub Products

Sliding around as discussed above, also includes across the portfolio of products. For example, using the CLI to create/filter/iterate/massage context as input into any surface. Saving conversation history "checkpoints" from any interaction in a consistent form, that can be used as continuation/branching points in any other surface. The ability to use /slash commands in any conversational surface to add determinism at different altitudes, like `/files **/*.cs --contains "..." --lines 3`, in GitHub Copilot chat, in the interactive CLI experience, in IDE extensions for GH CP Chat, in GH issues when replying to a PR with comment for Project Padawan to address... literally anywhere... Much like we have `@azure` extensibility points to invoke GH CP extensibility points, we should support similar `/files ...` `/websearch ...` and `--(file|page)-instructions ...` and `--instructinos ...` on each any /slash commands that make sense. 

Similarly, we should have "named" aliases for prompts, checkpoints, pipelines of /slash commands, etc... We should figure out how to "share"/"sync"/"import/export" or whatever.

## Superheros

I hope the points above about operating "in the middle" at "any point" on the multi-dimensional continuum of determinism, synchronicity, and command-orientedness, will help you see the "superheros" as being the "context slider" and the "branching/merging" of conversations.
