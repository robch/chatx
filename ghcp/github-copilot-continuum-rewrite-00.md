I have read the documents provided:

✓ github-cli-spec.md
✓ github-cli-spec-all-comments-2504-mar02-906am.md
✓ github-cli-spec-reboot-direction-my-thoughts-input.md
✓ github-cli-spec-reboot-direction.md

I have successfully reviewed all the documents provided. They outline a vision for GitHub Copilot CLI, stakeholder comments/questions about the original vision document, the author's thoughts on addressing those comments, and a proposed restructuring approach.

I understand that you're asking me not to perform any action yet other than confirming I've read the documents and to list any questions I might have.

I don't have any questions at this time - the documents provide comprehensive information about the GitHub Copilot CLI concept, the feedback it received, and potential directions for refining the vision.
