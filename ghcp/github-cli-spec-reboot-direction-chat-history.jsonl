While GitHub Copilot has revolutionized the IDE experience and Project Padawan is advancing autonomous issue resolution, a comprehensive terminal-based AI assistant represents the critical third leg of this strategy.\r\n\r\nThis paper outlines a vision for GitHub Copilot CLI, a next-generation Terminal Development Environment that would exceed the capabilities of Claude Code and other terminal-based coding assistants. Beyond simple code generation, GitHub Copilot CLI would empower developers with unprecedented context-gathering capabilities, putting them in control of how and when AI assistance is leveraged while providing powerful tools that surpass what\u0027s available in today\u0027s IDEs.\r\n\r\nAs a critical component of GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy, GitHub Copilot CLI would bridge the gap between the highly interactive IDE experience and the fully autonomous workflow of Project Padawan, allowing developers to be the \u0022superheroes\u0022 who decide exactly how AI augments their workflow.\r\n\r\n## The Terminal AI Coding Assistant Landscape\r\n\r\n### Current Market Leaders\r\n\r\nThe terminal-based AI coding assistant market currently includes several notable products:\r\n\r\n**Aider (Open Source)**: A git-integrated AI pair programmer with multi-file editing capabilities and repository mapping. It supports multiple AI models but lacks advanced context generation and enterprise features.\r\n\r\n**Claude Code (Anthropic)**: The most comprehensive terminal-based coding assistant, featuring deep code understanding, multi-file awareness, git integration, and a tiered permission system. It excels in its reasoning capabilities, GitHub integration, and support for Model Context Protocol (MCP). It has limitations in platform support (requiring WSL on Windows) and AI model providers.\r\n\r\n**My Coder (Ben Houston)**: An AI-powered command-line tool designed to integrate directly into existing development workflows. It stands out for its multi-provider support, robust local model capabilities, deep GitHub integration, browser-related research features, GitHub CI/CD integration, and support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\r\n\r\n**GitHub CLI Copilot Extension**: Focused specifically on command suggestions and explanations rather than comprehensive code editing or context exploration.\r\n\r\n**Goose (Block)**: An open-source AI development agent with both CLI and desktop interfaces. Goose stands out for its extensive cross-platform support (written in Rust), persistent session management, deep GitHub integration, and extensive third-party integrations via Model Context Protocol (MCP). It includes unique capabilities like screenshot UI analysis, voice interaction, and context-aware project understanding.\r\n\r\n### Key User Needs Not Fully Addressed\r\n\r\nResearch into user feedback reveals several critical needs in this space:\r\n\r\n1. **Developer-Controlled Context Gathering**: The need for powerful tools to systematically explore and curate context that far exceeds current IDE capabilities.\r\n2. **Cost Management**: Addressing expensive per-token pricing scenarios.\r\n3. **Windows Support**: Native Windows experience without requiring workarounds like WSL.\r\n4. **Multi-Model Flexibility**: Flexible selection of the AI model based on the task at hand.\r\n5. **Variable Autonomy**: The ability to adjust the balance between developer control and AI autonomy.\r\n6. **Deep GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub workflows, from issues and PRs to branch management.\r\n7. **Advanced Research Capabilities**: Browser automation and external context integration are essential for modern coding assistants.\r\n8. **Extensibility and Customization**: The ability for developers to create their own tools, workflows, and integrations that match their unique development processes.\r\n\r\n## Vision for GitHub Copilot CLI\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI would transform the terminal-based AI coding experience by providing a \u0022slider\u0022 between highly interactive assistance and autonomous operation, all while empowering developers with unprecedented context-gathering capabilities.\r\n\r\n### The Context Exploration Difference\r\n\r\nAt the heart of GitHub Copilot CLI\u0027s differentiation is a revolutionary approach to code exploration and context gathering:\r\n\r\n1. **Advanced Context Gathering Commands**: Powerful tools for developers to explicitly explore codebases:\r\n   - Glob-based file searching (\u0060**/*.js\u0060) and filtering (\u0060grep\u0060-like).\r\n   - Web search integration for up-to-date information not already available.\r\n   - Linguistic analysis of found files/pages/content via prompt pipelines.\r\n\r\n2. **Developers-in-Control Philosophy**: Unlike tools that either make developers add files manually or rely entirely on AI judgment, GitHub Copilot CLI empowers developers to:\r\n   - Explicitly build on-target context, not too much nor too little ... it\u0027s just right.\r\n   - Generate documentation from the codebase, for both team members and AI\u0027s growth over time.\r\n   - Guide the AI\u0027s focus precisely where it\u0027s needed, or let it roam freely, or anywhere in between.\r\n\r\n3. **Context Refinement Capabilities**: Tools to optimize gathered context:\r\n   - Summarization of large codebases, extracting key components and relationships.\r\n   - Multiple altitudes of context, from high-level overviews to PoV-specific understandings.\r\n   - Human guided or AI automated refinement of context.\r\n\r\n4. **Conversation Management Features**: Capabilities to maintain context across time and create branching explorations:\r\n   - Saving conversation history to persistent storage and reloading it in future sessions.\r\n   - Creating \u0022conversation branches\u0022 to explore different paths from a common starting point.\r\n   - Supporting aliases for common conversation workflows and contexts.\r\n\r\n5. **Customization and Extensibility Framework**: Rich capabilities for developers to tailor and extend functionality:\r\n   - Embracing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for third-party integrations.\r\n   - Custom chat commands, prompts, and aliases for frequently used operations.\r\n   - Rich prompt templating, variable substitution, and iterative evaluation capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Foundational Pillars\r\n\r\n1. **The Context Slider**: A revolutionary approach that allows developers to control how much context gathering they do explicitly versus delegating to the AI, creating a true \u0022superhero\u0022 experience where developers amplify their own expertise.\r\n\r\n2. **Provider-Agnostic Intelligence**: Support for multiple AI providers with Just-in-time model selection based on the specific operation, balancing capability, cost, and privacy.\r\n\r\n3. **Native Cross-Platform Excellence**: True native support across Windows, macOS, and Linux with special optimizations for Windows Terminal and PowerShell workflows.\r\n\r\n4. **Seamless Command Interface**: A unified command surface that combines conversational AI interaction with powerful terminal operations through an intuitive interface.\r\n\r\n5. **Complete GitHub Integration**: Deep connections to GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, workflows, and actions, creating a seamless experience across the GitHub ecosystem.\r\n\r\n6. **Open Extensibility Platform**: An extensible architecture that embraces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for third-party integrations, along with custom commands, prompts, aliases, and workflows.\r\n\r\n### Key Differentiating Capabilities\r\n\r\n1. **Developer-Led Context Exploration**: Unlike Claude Code\u0027s automated approach or other tools\u0027 limited file selection, GitHub Copilot CLI would provide developers with superior tools to explore, curate, and refine context before engaging the AI.\r\n\r\n2. **Variable Autonomy Model**: The ability to fluidly move between high developer control (explicit context, guided assistance) and high AI autonomy (independent AI exploration, solution generation).\r\n\r\n3. **Extensive Model Selection**: Just-in-time model selection allows choosing the most optimal AI model for each task, ensuring a balance between capability, cost, and performance.\r\n\r\n4. **Cross-Environment Awareness**: Maintain context awareness across terminal sessions, repositories, and even between GitHub Copilot CLI and GitHub Copilot in IDEs.\r\n\r\n5. **Enterprise-Ready Collaboration**: Designed with team and organization-wide features in mind, with shared context, team-based workflows, and enterprise settings and controls.\r\n\r\n## The Three Pillars of GitHub\u0027s AI Strategy\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI would complete GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy:\r\n\r\n1. **GitHub Copilot in IDEs**: Deeply embedded assistance where developers write code, offering suggestions, chat, and agent capabilities within the development environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Project Padawan**: Autonomous issue and PR handling that works independently on GitHub tasks, treating the AI as another team member that developers interact with through familiar GitHub interfaces.\r\n\r\n3. **GitHub Copilot CLI**: The critical middle ground that empowers developers and teams to be \u0022superheroes\u0022 in their own journey, controlling precisely how they leverage AI through powerful context exploration and refinement, flexible autonomy model, and extensive customization and extensibility.\r\n\r\nThis three-pillar approach creates a complete spectrum of AI assistance, from highly interactive to fully autonomous, allowing developers to choose the right approach for each task.\r\n\r\n## Competitive Differentiation\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI would differentiate from Claude Code and other competitors through:\r\n\r\n1. **Developer-Controlled Context**: Superior tools for developer-led context exploration versus Claude Code\u0027s automated but opaque approach.\r\n\r\n2. **GitHub Integration**: Seamless connection to the GitHub ecosystem versus limited or no GitHub awareness in current tools.\r\n\r\n3. **Platform Excellence**: True native Windows support versus Claude Code\u0027s Linux-centric design.\r\n\r\n4. **Advanced Research Capabilities**: Integrated web search and browser automation combined with a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for seamless extension with specialized tools.\r\n\r\n5. **Conversation Management**: Sophisticated conversation saving, loading, and branching capabilities that enable developers to maintain context over time and explore multiple solution paths.\r\n\r\n6. **Developer-Centric Customization**: Unparalleled flexibility for developers to create, share, and reuse custom workflows, commands, and integrations that match their unique development processes.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI represents the critical third pillar in GitHub\u0027s comprehensive AI developer strategy. By empowering developers with unprecedented context exploration capabilities and a flexible autonomy model, it bridges the gap between the highly interactive GitHub Copilot experience in IDEs and the fully autonomous approach of Project Padawan.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental differentiator is a developer-centric philosophy that recognizes developers as the \u0022superheroes\u0022 in the development process, providing them with context gathering superpowers far beyond what\u0027s available in today\u0027s IDEs. This approach puts developers firmly in control of how and when they leverage AI assistance, allowing them to adjust the level of autonomy to match each specific task.\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI\u0027s conversation management capabilities further enhance this developer-centric approach by enabling persistent context maintenance across time, tasks, and teams, exploration of multiple solution paths through conversation branching, and effective knowledge sharing across organizations. These features create a true context-rich environment where development teams can build on previous work, explore alternatives, and maintain comprehensive project history.\r\n\r\nBy building GitHub Copilot CLI with these principles at its core, GitHub would create a terminal-based AI development environment that not only exceeds the capabilities of Claude Code and other competitors but also completes a cohesive vision for AI-assisted development across all developer workflows.\r\n\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 1 - Why Now? Strategic Timing\r\n\r\nThe terminal-based AI assistant market represents a critical and rapidly closing window of opportunity. Several factors make this the ideal moment to launch GitHub Copilot CLI:\r\n\r\n1. **Rapidly Maturing Competitive Landscape**: Claude Code, MyCoder, and other tools are quickly establishing user expectations and workflows. The longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes to change developer habits.\r\n\r\n2. **Context Window Revolution**: Recent exponential growth in AI model context windows (from 8K to 200K\u002B tokens) has fundamentally changed what\u0027s possible in code comprehension. This creates a unique opportunity to introduce context exploration capabilities that weren\u0027t previously viable.\r\n\r\n3. **Terminal Renaissance**: We\u0027re experiencing a resurgence in terminal-based development with modern CLI tools, making this an optimal moment to integrate AI into this workflow.\r\n\r\n4. **Completion of the AI Strategy Triangle**: GitHub Copilot in IDEs and Project Padawan (autonomous agents) address two critical AI assistance models, but the middle ground\u2014where developers explicitly drive context gathering\u2014remains unclaimed territory with enormous strategic value.\r\n\r\n5. **Rising Complexity of Development**: The proliferation of microservices, distributed systems, and polyglot codebases has dramatically increased the context-switching burden on developers, creating urgent demand for better context management tools.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 2 - Why Microsoft/GitHub? Strategic Advantage\r\n\r\nMicrosoft and GitHub are uniquely positioned to lead in this space, with competitive advantages that create a compelling strategic imperative:\r\n\r\n1. **Contextual Knowledge Advantage**: GitHub\u0027s unparalleled visibility into code, issues, PRs, and workflows across millions of repositories provides a unique understanding of development contexts that competitors cannot match.\r\n\r\n2. **The Copilot Brand Promise**: The Copilot brand stands for AI assistance that amplifies developer capabilities rather than replacing them\u2014perfectly aligned with the \u0022developer as superhero\u0022 philosophy of GitHub Copilot CLI.\r\n\r\n3. **Windows Leadership Position**: Microsoft\u0027s ownership of Windows Terminal and PowerShell provides unique opportunities for deep integration on the Windows platform\u2014a critical advantage over competitors like Claude Code that struggle with Windows support.\r\n\r\n4. **Developer Ecosystem Defense**: Terminal-based development represents a critical touchpoint in the developer workflow that Microsoft cannot afford to cede to competitors, as it would create a vulnerability in Microsoft\u0027s comprehensive developer toolchain.\r\n\r\n5. **Full SDLC Protection**: This completes Microsoft\u0027s AI-assisted coverage across the entire software development lifecycle, preventing competitors from establishing beachheads in any part of the development workflow.\r\n\r\n6. **Platform Integration Opportunities**: Unique integration possibilities with Azure, Visual Studio, VS Code, and the broader Microsoft ecosystem create differentiation that is difficult for competitors to replicate.\r\n\r\n7. **GitHub as the Developer Center**: This reinforces GitHub\u0027s position as the center of the developer universe by extending integrated AI assistance to all developer touchpoints, strengthening the overall ecosystem.\r\n\r\n8. **Data Flywheel Effect**: Context gathering at scale provides valuable insights to improve future AI models, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement that benefits all Microsoft developer products.\r\n\r\nIf Microsoft does not move quickly to establish leadership in this space, we risk creating a vulnerability in our developer strategy that competitors will exploit, potentially eroding our position in the broader developer ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 3 - Terminal Renaissance\r\n\r\nThere is substantial data-driven evidence demonstrating that we\u0027re experiencing a significant resurgence in terminal usage and innovation - a true \u0022terminal renaissance\u0022 that creates a strategic imperative for GitHub Copilot CLI.\r\n\r\n### Key Evidence Categories\r\n\r\n1. **Investment Signals \u0026 Market Recognition**\r\n   - Significant venture capital funding for terminal-focused startups (e.g., Warp Terminal raised $60M\u002B with a $290M\u002B valuation)\r\n   - Major platform investments like Microsoft Windows Terminal and cross-platform PowerShell\r\n   - Growing commercial recognition of terminal importance in developer workflows\r\n\r\n2. **Developer Adoption Metrics**\r\n   - Stack Overflow Survey shows 71% of professional developers use command-line interfaces daily\r\n   - JetBrains data indicates 92% of developers use the terminal at least weekly\r\n   - GitHub CLI exceeded 6 million installations with strong growth trajectory\r\n\r\n3. **Terminal Productivity Tool Explosion**\r\n   - Terminal customization tools like Oh My Zsh have grown to 177,000\u002B GitHub stars\r\n   - Modern CLI tools like Ripgrep (50,000\u002B stars) and fzf (69,000\u002B stars) showing massive adoption\r\n   - Package managers like Homebrew seeing 26.5% year-over-year growth\r\n\r\n4. **DevOps Movement Driving CLI Usage**\r\n   - Infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, Kubernetes) requiring terminal proficiency\r\n   - 85% of organizations using some form of GitOps (primarily CLI-driven)\r\n   - CI/CD pipelines predominantly configured through terminal-based interfaces\r\n\r\n5. **Terminal Feature Evolution**\r\n   - Modern terminals now support rich content, GPU acceleration, and advanced multiplexing\r\n   - 74% of VS Code\u0027s 25M\u002B monthly active developers use its integrated terminal\r\n   - Growth of cloud development environments making terminal interfaces central\r\n\r\nThis data paints a clear picture that terminal usage isn\u0027t declining\u2014it\u0027s experiencing a renaissance with growing adoption, investment, and innovation. Believing Microsoft and GitHub could delay entering this space would be a grave strategic miscalculation. The terminal renaissance is not a passing trend; it\u0027s a fundamental shift in how developers work, and GitHub Copilot CLI is the perfect solution to capitalize on this momentum.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 4 - Real-World User Scenarios\r\n\r\n### Scenario 1: The Enterprise Architect Exploring a New Microservice Architecture\r\n\r\nAn enterprise architect needs to understand a complex microservice architecture with dozens of services before planning a refactoring strategy.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Claude Code:**\r\nThe architect manually points Claude code to what they think are the important files, but they don\u0027t know what they don\u0027t know.

They manually suggest files or patterns they suspect, but the lack of determinism often leads to a haphazard investigation.\r\n\r\n**GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**\r\n\r\nGitHub Copilot CLI provides commands for identifying authentication code, input validation analysis, and composite security report generation, allowing developers to focus on the most relevant areas of the codebase.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\r\n# Step 1: Find all authentication and authorization code\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022authenticate|authorize|login|session|token|jwt\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Identify potential security vulnerabilities related to authentication\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/auth/{fileBase}-vulnerabilities.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize authentication and authorization code, including potential vulnerabilities\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/auth/authentication-vulnerabilities-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Examine input validation across the codebase\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --contains \u0022validate|sanitize|escape\u0022 \\\r\n  --lines-before 10 --lines-after 10 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Analyze whether inputs are properly validated before use\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/validation/{fileBase}-analysis.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities\r\ngithub-copilot \u0022Find SQL query construction\u0022 --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --contains \u0022SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE.*FROM\u0022 \\\r\n  --lines-before 100 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Check if any SQL queries are constructed in a way that could allow SQL injection attacks\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/sql/{fileBase}-injection-risks.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize SQL query construction and potential injection risks\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/sql/sql-injection-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 4: Analyze HTTP header handling for security issues\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022**/*.{js,ts,cs}\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-contains \u0022header|ContentType|X-\u0022 \\\r\n  --file-instructions \u0022Check for proper HTTP header validation and security-related headers\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-file-output \u0022security-audit/headers/{fileBase}-analysis.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Summarize HTTP header handling and potential security issues\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/headers/http-headers-summary.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 5: Process all the findings to identify the vulnerability\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022security-audit/**/*.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Based on all the collected security analyses, identify the most likely vulnerability that matches the reported issue, its root cause, and recommended remediation steps\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/vulnerability-report.md\u0022\r\n\r\n# Step 6: Generate a patch for the vulnerability\r\ngithub-copilot --files \u0022security-audit/vulnerability-report.md\u0022 \\\r\n  --instructions \u0022Generate pull request that addresses the identified vulnerabilities, in a new branch\u0022 \\\r\n  --save-output \u0022security-audit/fixsecurity-vulnerability-pr.md\u0022\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis approach allows the developer to conduct a systematic security audit, focusing on different security aspects and building a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability before generating a fix locally.\r\n\r\n### Scenario 3: Learning a New Framework through Web Research and Codebase Exploration\r\n\r\nBy integrating web search commands and file exploration, GitHub Copilot CLI lets developers learn new frameworks\u2014combining the benefits of explicit context collection with deep analysis, a strategy similar to MyCoder\u2019s integrated research and code exploration features.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Claude Code:**\r\nThe developer would need to use a separate tool for web research, and then manually share that information with Claude Code.

GitHub Copilot CLI\u0027s conversation management capabilities make this possible through conversation saving, loading, and branching.\r\n\r\n**Current Approach with Other Tools:**\r\nDevelopers must either maintain one continuous conversation (risking token limits and confusion) or start fresh conversations (losing valuable context).

The conversation branches serve as documentation of the development journey and can be referenced later to understand design decisions.\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 5 - Open Questions\r\n\r\n### Business \u0026 Strategy\r\n\r\n1. **Business Model \u0026 Monetization**: How does GitHub Copilot CLI integrate into our existing monetization strategy? Will it be a premium add-on to GitHub Copilot, part of a specific tier, or bundled with enterprise offerings?\r\n\r\n2. **Go-to-Market Strategy**: What is our rollout plan and timeline? How do we phase adoption across different customer segments (individual developers, teams, enterprises)? What channels do we prioritize?\r\n\r\n3. **Investment Requirements**: What level of investment is needed to build and scale this product? What is the anticipated team size, timeline, and key development milestones?\r\n\r\n4. **Success Metrics**: Beyond adoption numbers, what KPIs will determine success? How will we measure impact on developer productivity, GitHub ecosystem engagement, and competitive positioning?\r\n\r\n5. **Competitive Response Strategy**: How do we anticipate Claude Code and other competitors will respond? What is our plan to maintain differentiation as they inevitably add similar features?\r\n\r\n### Technical \u0026 Integration\r\n\r\n1. **Integration with Existing Portfolio**: How specifically does this integrate with GitHub Copilot in IDEs? Will conversations and context be synchronized across environments? What is the integration path with GitHub.com, GitHub Desktop, and other products?\r\n\r\n2. **Platform Strategy**: Is there an extensibility model that allows third parties to build additional capabilities? How might this become a platform rather than just a product?\r\n\r\n3. **Security \u0026 Compliance**: What security measures will be in place for sensitive codebases? How do we address enterprise concerns about code privacy and intellectual property protection?\r\n\r\n4. **AI Provider Strategy**: What is our multi-provider approach beyond just supporting multiple models? How do we balance using our own models vs. others? What are the cost implications?\r\n\r\n5. **Performance Benchmarks**: What performance benchmarks must we hit for developer acceptance? How do we balance the depth of context exploration with responsiveness?\r\n\r\n## APPENDIX Part 6 - Competitors\r\n\r\n**Primary:**  \r\n[Aider - Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)  \r\n[Anthropic - Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)  \r\n[DriveCore - MyCoder](https://github.com/drivecore/mycoder)  \r\n\r\n**Others:**  \r\n[Azure AI CLI](https://github.com/azure/azure-ai-cli)  \r\n[Block - Goose](https://github.com/block/goose)  \r\n[Callstack - AI-CLI](https://github.com/callstack/ai-cli)  \r\n[PrefectHQ - Marvin CLI](https://github.com/prefecthq/marvin)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis doc i\u0027m writing focuses on \u0027cli\u0027 and \u0027terminal\u0027 more than I want it to...

This isn\u0027t inherently tied to terminals - it\u0027s about the command-oriented interaction model versus conversation-only models.\\n\\n## Broader Conceptualization:\\n\\nInstead of positioning this as a \\\u0022Terminal-Based AI Development Environment,\\\u0022 we could reframe it as a \\\u0022Command-Oriented AI Development Environment\\\u0022 that:\\n\\n1. Can be implemented across multiple interfaces (terminal, desktop app, web interface, in IDE, etc.)\\n2. Focuses on explicit commands for context building rather than purely conversational approaches\\n3. Addresses various user personas including traditional developers, \\\u0022Vibe coders,\\\u0022 and non-technical stakeholders\\n4. Complements rather than competes with existing products like GitHub Copilot in IDEs\\n\\n## Approaches to Address This:\\n\\n### 1. Rename and Reposition\\n\\n**From**: \\\u0022GitHub Copilot CLI: The Next-Generation Terminal-Based AI Development Environment\\\u0022\\n\\n**To**: \\\u0022GitHub Copilot Command: The Next-Generation Command-Oriented AI Development Environment\\\u0022\\n\\nThis shift moves away from the CLI/terminal focus while keeping the command-oriented approach that differentiates it.\\n\\n### 2. Expand Interface Options\\n\\nAdd a section discussing how this command-oriented approach can be implemented across multiple interfaces:\\n- Terminal for traditional developers\\n- Standalone desktop application for \\\u0022Vibe coders\\\u0022 and less technical users\\n- Web interface for casual users or quick tasks\\n- Integration with existing IDEs for seamless workflow\\n\\n### 3. Address the \\\u0022Vibe Coder\\\u0022 Persona\\n\\nCreate a specific section discussing how this command-oriented approach benefits users who aren\u0027t traditional developers but want to build applications. Show how explicit commands can actually be more approachable than purely conversational interfaces for specific tasks.\\n\\n### 4. Position Relative to Emerging Desktop AI Apps\\n\\nAdd content that acknowledges and positions this approach relative to the evolution of ChatGPT Desktop and Claude Desktop into lightweight development environments. Explain how the command-oriented approach complements and enhances these environments rather than competing directly with them.\\n\\n### 5. Reframe the Examples\\n\\nThe current examples are very terminal-centric with bash-style commands. These could be reframed to show:\\n- How the same command pattern could look in a desktop UI\\n- How non-technical users might interact with these commands\\n- How the commands could integrate with existing platforms\\n\\n### 6. Emphasize the \\\u0022Context Superhero\\\u0022 Concept More\\n\\nThe strongest part of the document is the idea of making developers \\\u0022superheroes\\\u0022 through explicit context control. This concept isn\u0027t inherently terminal-based and deserves more emphasis as the key differentiator.\\n\\n### 7. Expand the Three Pillars of GitHub\u0027s AI Strategy\\n\\nModify the three pillars to be more interface-agnostic:\\n1. **IDE Integration** (GitHub Copilot in IDEs)\\n2. **Autonomous Agents** (Project Padawan)\\n3. **Command-Oriented Development** (GitHub Copilot Command)\\n4. [NEW] **AI-Native Environments** (addressing the standalone AI app evolution)\\n\\n### 8. Visual Representation\\n\\nInclude mock-ups or concepts of how this command-oriented approach might look in different interfaces - not just terminal screenshots but also desktop UI, web interfaces, etc.\\n\\n## Summary of Approach:\\n\\nThe core value proposition isn\u0027t about terminals - it\u0027s about explicit command-oriented control over AI assistance versus purely conversational or fully autonomous approaches. By reframing the document to focus on this command-oriented paradigm rather than the specific terminal implementation, we can address the commenter\u0027s point and create a more inclusive vision that appeals to all types of users, from traditional developers to \\\u0022Vibe coders.\\\u0022\u0022}"},"type":"function"}]}

This approach gives developers unprecedented control over context-gathering while accommodating various skill levels and preferences.\n\n### Implementation Flexibility\n\nThe command-oriented paradigm can be experienced through:\n\n1. **CLI Interface**: For terminal-comfortable developers who value speed and efficiency\n2. **Desktop Application**: A dedicated environment with visual command building for \u0022Vibe coders\u0022 and less terminal-oriented users\n3. **Web Interface**: Accessible anywhere without installation for quick assistance\n4. **IDE Integration**: Command capabilities embedded directly within existing development environments\n\nThis flexibility ensures that all developers - from coding experts to those just beginning their journey - can leverage the power of explicit context control in their preferred environment.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n# Approach 4: Create a Dedicated Section for \u0022Vibe Coders\u0022\n\nAdd a section specifically addressing how this command-oriented approach benefits non-traditional developers:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060markdown\n## Empowering the Next Generation of Creators\n\nThe development landscape is evolving beyond traditional coding specialists to include a growing segment of \u0022Vibe coders\u0022 - individuals who may not have deep programming knowledge but want to create applications with AI assistance. \n\nFor these creators, conventional terminals can be intimidating, while purely conversational interfaces often lack the structure needed for complex development tasks. GitHub Copilot Command bridges this gap by:\n\n1. **Providing Structured Commands**: Clear commands that guide users through the development process without requiring terminal expertise\n2. **Offering Visual Command Building**: In desktop and web implementations, visual command construction reduces the learning curve\n3. **Creating Progressive Complexity**: Simple commands for beginners, with the ability to compose more complex operations as skills develop\n4. **Supporting Natural Language Command Creation**: Allowing users to describe what they want to accomplish and having the system generate the appropriate commands\n\nThis approach democratizes development while still providing the power and precision that complex software creation requires.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n# Approach 5: Modify the Example Scenarios\n\nYour current examples use terminal-style commands.

These platforms are increasingly becoming lightweight development environments in their own right.\n\nGitHub Copilot Command is designed to enhance rather than compete with these environments by:\n\n1. **Providing Structured Context Building**: While Canvas and Artifacts offer free-form workspaces, Command provides structured approaches to systematically gather and refine context\n  \n2. **Offering Deep GitHub Integration**: Seamless connection to repositories, issues, and the broader development workflow that standalone AI apps currently lack\n\n3. **Supporting the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Enabling integration with these platforms through standardized protocols\n\n4. **Focusing on Development-Specific Commands**: Specialized tooling for code exploration, analysis, and manipulation that generic AI platforms may not prioritize\n\nAs these platforms continue to evolve, GitHub Copilot Command can serve as either a complementary tool or as the command engine powering development-focused features within these environments.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n# Approach 7: Create a \u0022Multiple Interfaces, One Experience\u0022 Section\n\nAdd content that emphasizes how the command-oriented paradigm creates consistency across different interfaces:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060markdown\n## Multiple Interfaces, One Powerful Experience\n\nThe true innovation of GitHub Copilot Command isn\u0027t in the specific interface it uses, but in the command-oriented paradigm it introduces. This paradigm can be implemented across multiple interfaces while maintaining consistent capabilities:\n\n1. **Conceptual Consistency**: Whether in a terminal, desktop application, or web interface, the same powerful context-building commands are available\n  \n2. **Skill Transferability**: Knowledge gained in one interface transfers seamlessly to others as users\u0027 needs or preferences evolve\n\n3. **Team Compatibility**: Different team members can use their preferred interface while working within the same command paradigm\n\n4. **Progressive Adoption**: Organizations can start with familiar interfaces and gradually adopt more specialized ones as their comfort level increases\n\nThis multi-interface approach ensures that all developers can access the power of command-oriented AI assistance in the environment where they feel most productive.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n# Implementation Recommendation\n\nI recommend implementing a combination of these approaches:\n\n1. Change the name from \u0022GitHub Copilot CLI\u0022 to \u0022GitHub Copilot Command\u0022 throughout the document\n2. Add the fourth pillar to acknowledge standalone AI applications\n3.

Shift from \u0022Product-First\u0022 to \u0022Capabilities-First\u0022 Framing\n\nInstead of positioning this as \u0022We need a CLI product to compete with Claude Code,\u0022 reframe as \u0022We need these AI developer assistance capabilities across our ecosystem.\u0022 The CLI could then be presented as one implementation among several.\n\n### 2.

Connect to Existing GitHub Products\n\nShow how this initiative builds on and integrates with existing GitHub products rather than competing with them. Address Matt\u0027s question about whether this is an extension to \u0060gh\u0060 or something completely new.\n\n### 5. Harmonize AI Strategy\n\nReconcile the apparent contradiction between this initiative\u0027s \u0022multi-model flexibility\u0022 and Padawan\u0027s \u0022best model is an implementation detail\u0022 approach. Present a coherent cross-product AI strategy.\n\n### 6.

Address the \u0022Fourth Area\u0022 Comments\n\nIncorporate the standalone AI desktop application concept as part of the broader platform vision, not as a competitor to your strategy.\n\n## Practical Next Steps\n\n1. Retitle the document to focus on capabilities rather than implementation surface (e.g., \u0022GitHub Copilot Context: Enhanced Context Capabilities Across the GitHub Ecosystem\u0022)\n\n2.

{"role":"user","content":"Here are my thoughts on the key issues to address and the practical next steps you suggest...\r\n\r\n## Why CLI vs IDE integration\r\n\r\nWell, I do think many of the innovations here need to exist across all our GitHub products. Explicit vs implicit context is a good example. Certainly the IDE and Project Padawan should have these abilities, in some form. \r\n\r\nLike \u0060git\u0060 and git capabilities, in the broadest sense, they exist in IDEs as extensions/gui integrations, like GitLens and others. There\u0027s even a full blown GitHub Desktop app. But, underneath all of that, they are based on either the CLI or the API. \r\n\r\nThere are many features exposed via the CLI that are not exposed in the IDE. For example, the CLI has a \u0060git stash\u0060 command, but the IDE does not. The IDE has a \u0022stash\u0022 button, but it doesn\u0027t expose all the features of \u0060git stash\u0060.\r\n\r\nPartly this is because the IDE is a GUI, and GUIs are not as flexible as CLIs. GUIs are also much more difficult to build and maintain. In addition, most GUIs aren\u0027t \u0022command oriented\u0022 like CLIs are. GUIs are more visual representation of the underlying data, and visual reinforcement of the capabilities. WYSIWYG. Both in data, and in the commands.\r\n\r\nWhereas, CLIs are more about the commands, and iterating on the commands. A set of shell interactions is a \u0022conversation\u0022 with and about the underlying data, using commands, either built-in to the shell, or custom via CLIs and shell scripts. \r\n\r\nThis underlying \u0022conversation\u0022 that CLIs are part of in the shell sessions (aka conversational flow) is a key part of the \u0022magic\u0022 of CLIs. It\u0027s also a key part of the \u0022magic\u0022 of the shell itself. The shell is a command interpreter, and the CLI is a command interpreter. The shell is a command line interface, and the CLI is a command line interface.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, I see the LLM boom as a new \u0022shell\u0022 for the \u0022commands\u0022 (via tool calling, and CLIs as tools).\r\n\r\n## Lack of Concrete Differentiation\r\n\r\nNot articulated well enough, yet, I believe the differentiation is a blending/blurring of the continuum of options between fully deterministic and fully non-deterministic. GenAI is in some sense the far end of the non-deterministic side of the continuum. CLIs (and command pattern apps and experiences in general) are the deterministic side of the continuum.\r\n\r\nIn Project Padawan, the users have very little deterministic control over the experience. They are at the mercy of the LLM, and the LLM is at the mercy of the data it was trained on. The LLM receives an issue to work on, or comments on the PR it produced, and it uses it\u0027s own \u0022intelligence\u0022 to produce or update the PR. The system is also nearly fully asynchronous, with large segments of time between user interactions with the LLMs outputs/results.\r\n\r\nWhereas, with GitHub Copilot as integrated into the IDE, there are a few deterministic controls, but not much. The user can attach a file, or multiple files, to the chat, or they can select ranges of code in the editor before invoking Copilot. Beyond that, there is little the user can do to \u0022input\u0022 or \u0022massage\u0022/\u0022iterate\u0022 on the context he/she wants to provide to the LLM. The user is still at the mercy of the LLM, and the LLM is still at the mercy of the data it was trained on. The system is highly synchronous, with the user and LLM working together in real-time, with almost no ability to infuse \u0022longer time\u0022 \u0022research\u0022 or \u0022exploration\u0022 or \u0022iteration\u0022 on the contextual input to the LLM. All the interactions withthe LLM are either linguistic, or small sized non-iterative code snippets, or full file references. \r\n\r\nThe differentiation I\u0027m proposing is in the \u0022Context slider\u0022 is the ability to operate at either end of the continuum, and to be able to \u0022slide\u0022 the context slider back and forth between the two ends. The user can opeate more like Project Padawan, and use almost no deterministic inputs, staying in the land of linguistic inputs, and the LLM will do all the work. Or, the user can operate more like a CLI, and use almost all deterministic inputs (searching for context via file globs, regular expressions, etc., pushing full files or contextual ranges (e.g. --contains \u0022auth|login|blah\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50)). They can also operate in a synchronous fashion, but with a bit more non-determinism, like a \u0022sidebar-use-of-LLM\u0022 to linguistically massage the outputs of their file-finding/code-block-finding via globs and regexes, to \u0022transform\u0022 the outputs to a certain way, then, injecting that into the primary LLM chat/task at hand. For example, \u0060--files **\\*.cs --contains \u0022public|protected\u0022 --lines-before 20 --lines-after 50 --file-instructions \u0022find all public/protected methods in this file, output as a table, column 1 method name, column 2 parameters, column 3 return type, column 4 brief description\u0022\u0060 ... This hybrid semi-deterministic \u0022in-line\u0022 approach gives more control to the developer.\r\n\r\nThis blend of fully deterministic, fully non-deterministic, and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between them semi-deterministically, also allows for either \u0022in-line\u0022 (synchronous) injection of context sort of \u0022one-shot\u0022 or, using the CLI, you might use the CLI over and over again, conversationally, or with piping, or using input and output files, to find/filter/and massage the context you want to provide to the LLM. This then provides another slider on the sychronicity of the experience. The user can operate in a fully synchronous mode, or a fully asynchronous mode, or a hybrid of the two. \r\n\r\nTo do that effectively, the system needs to be designed more as a \u0022command oriented system\u0022, with \u0022pipelines\u0022 and \u0022memory/storage\u0022 (files, in memory variables, etc.) and \u0022commands\u0022 (be they CLIs, or slash commands in an input control). This doesn\u0027t require a CLI as an approach, but, CLIs inside shells are fundamentally designed in this fashion. \r\n\r\nOne final aspect to differentiation is the ability to output, input, and branch out, the chat-history of the conversation with the LLM. For example, I might use an interative approach to building up the context, and I want to then, \u0022check-point\u0022 the conversation, and store as a named \u0022conversation\u0022 (likely as a file on disk, stored in JSONL format of content/role messags to/from the LLM). I can then use that \u0022conversation\u0022 as a \u0022context\u0022 (starting point) for the next conversation, or I can use it as a \u0022branch point\u0022 to explore other branches of the conversation. This is similar to how Git works, and how GitHub works. The ability to branch out, and then merge back in, is a key part of the GitHub experience. Branching my interactions with the LLM at different \u0022save points\u0022 will allow developers to explore alternate conversational paths, both interactively, and programmatically.\r\n\r\nSo, summarizing my thoughts on the differentiation, I see it as a blend of:\r\n- Fully deterministic vs fully non-deterministic\r\n- Synchronous vs asynchronous\r\n- Command oriented vs GUI oriented\r\n- Context slider (and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between the two ends of the continuum)\r\n- Branching and merging of conversations\r\n- Checkpointing and saving of conversations\r\n\r\n## Feature Repetition Without Detail\r\n\r\nAgreed, there is too much repitition in the document. I want to fix that, and make the document both more streamlined, less repeitive, but also more detailed in the areas that are important.\r\n\r\nOn the repitition part about \u0022context exploration\u0022, I hope my dissertation above on the \u0022context slider\u0022 and the \u0022differentiation\u0022 between the two ends of the continuum, and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between them, will help you see what I\u0027m going for.\r\n\r\n## Integration Questions\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a good question about will this land inside \u0060gh\u0060 CLI as a sub-command, or as a separate CLI. There are a lot of implementation details here, for example, if the core of it is written in TypeScript like is Padawan, and the existing \u0060gh\u0060 CLI is written in Go, then it might be easier to build a new CLI. If the core of it is written in Go, then it might be easier to build it as a sub-command of \u0060gh\u0060.\r\n\r\nWe should probably call this out in the document, at least as a talking point/open question, if not a full section discussing what we need to do as next steps to figure this out.\r\n\r\n## Strategy Inconsistency\r\n\r\nI dont\u0027 think there\u0027s actually a strategy inconsistency, per se, as for GitHub Copilot in IDEs, it is certainly a \u0022multi-model-provider\u0022 messaging. Matt was talking about tthat for Project Padawan, the near term is a \u0022we\u0027ll pick the best provider\u0022, but ... certainly Microsoft\u0027s strategy all up is to provide model portability, and potentially even model provider portability. Both GitHub Model Marketplace and Azure AI Foundry both are about that. So, I think the strategy is consistent, but the messaging in this document is probably nt yet clear enough.\r\n\r\n## Multi-surface Strategy\r\n\r\nClearly, Microsoft/GitHub need a multi-surface strategy. We must \u0022meet the develoeprs where they are\u0022 ... That\u0027s across several fronts:\r\n- IDEs (VSCode, VS, JetBrains, IntelliJ, etc.)\r\n- Lightweight \u0022Vibe coding\u0022 experiences\r\n- Desktop, Mobile, and Web experiences\r\n- GUIs, Command oriented, and CLIs\r\n\r\n## Connecting to other DevDiv/GitHub Products\r\n\r\nSliding around as discussed above, also includes across the portfolio of products. For example, using the CLI to create/filter/iterate/massage context as input into any surface. Saving conversation history \u0022checkpoints\u0022 from any interaction in a consistent form, that can be used as continuation/branching points in any other surface. The ability to use /slash commands in any conversational surface to add determinism at different altitudes, like \u0060/files **/*.cs --contains \u0022...\u0022 --lines 3\u0060, in GitHub Copilot chat, in the interactive CLI experience, in IDE extensions for GH CP Chat, in GH issues when replying to a PR with comment for Project Padawan to address... literally anywhere... Much like we have \u0060@azure\u0060 extensibility points to invoke GH CP extensibility points, we should support similar \u0060/files ...\u0060 \u0060/websearch ...\u0060 and \u0060--(file|page)-instructions ...\u0060 and \u0060--instructinos ...\u0060 on each any /slash commands that make sense. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, we should have \u0022named\u0022 aliases for prompts, checkpoints, pipelines of /slash commands, etc... We should figure out how to \u0022share\u0022/\u0022sync\u0022/\u0022import/export\u0022 or whatever.\r\n\r\n## Superheros\r\n\r\nI hope the points above about operating \u0022in the middle\u0022 at \u0022any point\u0022 on the multi-dimensional continuum of determinism, synchronicity, and command-orientedness, will help you see the \u0022superheros\u0022 as being the \u0022context slider\u0022 and the \u0022branching/merging\u0022 of conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n...so ... now ... re think your ideas/suggestions/next steps based on that"}

For example, I might use an interative approach to building up the context, and I want to then, \u0022check-point\u0022 the conversation, and store as a named \u0022conversation\u0022 (likely as a file on disk, stored in JSONL format of content/role messags to/from the LLM). I can then use that \u0022conversation\u0022 as a \u0022context\u0022 (starting point) for the next conversation, or I can use it as a \u0022branch point\u0022 to explore other branches of the conversation. This is similar to how Git works, and how GitHub works. The ability to branch out, and then merge back in, is a key part of the GitHub experience. Branching my interactions with the LLM at different \u0022save points\u0022 will allow developers to explore alternate conversational paths, both interactively, and programmatically.\r\n\r\nSo, summarizing my thoughts on the differentiation, I see it as a blend of:\r\n- Fully deterministic vs fully non-deterministic\r\n- Synchronous vs asynchronous\r\n- Command oriented vs GUI oriented\r\n- Context slider (and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between the two ends of the continuum)\r\n- Branching and merging of conversations\r\n- Checkpointing and saving of conversations\r\n\r\n## Feature Repetition Without Detail\r\n\r\nAgreed, there is too much repitition in the document. I want to fix that, and make the document both more streamlined, less repeitive, but also more detailed in the areas that are important.\r\n\r\nOn the repitition part about \u0022context exploration\u0022, I hope my dissertation above on the \u0022context slider\u0022 and the \u0022differentiation\u0022 between the two ends of the continuum, and the ability to \u0022slide\u0022 between them, will help you see what I\u0027m going for.\r\n\r\n## Integration Questions\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a good question about will this land inside \u0060gh\u0060 CLI as a sub-command, or as a separate CLI. There are a lot of implementation details here, for example, if the core of it is written in TypeScript like is Padawan, and the existing \u0060gh\u0060 CLI is written in Go, then it might be easier to build a new CLI. If the core of it is written in Go, then it might be easier to build it as a sub-command of \u0060gh\u0060.\r\n\r\nWe should probably call this out in the document, at least as a talking point/open question, if not a full section discussing what we need to do as next steps to figure this out.\r\n\r\n## Strategy Inconsistency\r\n\r\nI dont\u0027 think there\u0027s actually a strategy inconsistency, per se, as for GitHub Copilot in IDEs, it is certainly a \u0022multi-model-provider\u0022 messaging. Matt was talking about tthat for Project Padawan, the near term is a \u0022we\u0027ll pick the best provider\u0022, but ... certainly Microsoft\u0027s strategy all up is to provide model portability, and potentially even model provider portability. Both GitHub Model Marketplace and Azure AI Foundry both are about that. So, I think the strategy is consistent, but the messaging in this document is probably nt yet clear enough.\r\n\r\n## Multi-surface Strategy\r\n\r\nClearly, Microsoft/GitHub need a multi-surface strategy. We must \u0022meet the develoeprs where they are\u0022 ... That\u0027s across several fronts:\r\n- IDEs (VSCode, VS, JetBrains, IntelliJ, etc.)\r\n- Lightweight \u0022Vibe coding\u0022 experiences\r\n- Desktop, Mobile, and Web experiences\r\n- GUIs, Command oriented, and CLIs\r\n\r\n## Connecting to other DevDiv/GitHub Products\r\n\r\nSliding around as discussed above, also includes across the portfolio of products. For example, using the CLI to create/filter/iterate/massage context as input into any surface. Saving conversation history \u0022checkpoints\u0022 from any interaction in a consistent form, that can be used as continuation/branching points in any other surface. The ability to use /slash commands in any conversational surface to add determinism at different altitudes, like \u0060/files **/*.cs --contains \u0022...\u0022 --lines 3\u0060, in GitHub Copilot chat, in the interactive CLI experience, in IDE extensions for GH CP Chat, in GH issues when replying to a PR with comment for Project Padawan to address... literally anywhere... Much like we have \u0060@azure\u0060 extensibility points to invoke GH CP extensibility points, we should support similar \u0060/files ...\u0060 \u0060/websearch ...\u0060 and \u0060--(file|page)-instructions ...\u0060 and \u0060--instructinos ...\u0060 on each any /slash commands that make sense. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, we should have \u0022named\u0022 aliases for prompts, checkpoints, pipelines of /slash commands, etc... We should figure out how to \u0022share\u0022/\u0022sync\u0022/\u0022import/export\u0022 or whatever.\r\n\r\n## Superheros\r\n\r\nI hope the points above about operating \u0022in the middle\u0022 at \u0022any point\u0022 on the multi-dimensional continuum of determinism, synchronicity, and command-orientedness, will help you see the \u0022superheros\u0022 as being the \u0022context slider\u0022 and the \u0022branching/merging\u0022 of conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n...so ... now ... re think your ideas/suggestions/next steps based on that"}

Let me reconsider my recommendations based on your feedback:\\n\\n## Core Insights from Your Response\\n\\n1. **The Core Innovation is the \\\u0022Context Slider\\\u0022**: You\u0027re proposing a fundamentally new paradigm that spans the continuum between fully deterministic (CLI-style) and fully non-deterministic (GenAI) approaches. This \\\u0022slider\\\u0022 allows developers to precisely control where on this spectrum they want to operate for any given task.\\n\\n2. **Multiplicity of Dimensions**: This isn\u0027t just about determinism, but multiple axes:\\n   - Deterministic vs. non-deterministic\\n   - Synchronous vs. asynchronous\\n   - One-shot context vs. iterative context refinement\\n   - Command-oriented vs. conversation-oriented\\n\\n3. **Conversation Management as a First-Class Concept**: The ability to checkpoint, branch, and merge conversations is a powerful Git-like metaphor that hasn\u0027t been well-articulated in the document.\\n\\n4. **CLI as a Natural First Implementation**: While these capabilities should eventually span the entire GitHub product suite, the CLI/terminal environment is a natural first implementation because:\\n   - Terminal sessions are already structured around command sequences\\n   - CLIs naturally support command composability and piping\\n   - The shell environment already has the concept of state persistence\\n\\n5. **Platform-Level Innovation**: This isn\u0027t just a product but a platform-level capability that should eventually be exposed across all GitHub surfaces.\\n\\n## New Recommended Approach\\n\\nBased on these insights, here\u0027s my revised recommendation for restructuring the document:\\n\\n### 1. Lead with the \\\u0022Context Slider\\\u0022 Paradigm\\n\\nStart by articulating this new paradigm clearly - not as a feature but as a fundamental rethinking of how developers can interact with AI. This should be positioned as GitHub\u0027s unique innovation in the AI development space.\\n\\n### 2. Frame the CLI as the \\\u0022Reference Implementation\\\u0022\\n\\nRather than positioning this primarily as a CLI product competing with Claude Code, frame it as a new AI interaction paradigm whose first and most complete implementation will be in the terminal environment. Explain why the terminal is the natural first home for this approach (command composability, state management, etc.).\\n\\n### 3. Present a Clear Roadmap for Cross-Product Implementation\\n\\nShow how this paradigm will eventually extend across all GitHub surfaces, with each surface implementing the capabilities in ways that make sense for that environment. For example:\\n- Terminal: Full command syntax\\n- IDE: Slash commands in chat \u002B UI affordances\\n- GitHub web: Integrated context tools in PR/issue interfaces\\n- Lightweight experiences: Simplified command builders\\n\\n### 4. Provide Detailed Examples of the Context Slider in Action\\n\\nUse concrete examples to show how developers can:\\n- Start with fully deterministic context gathering\\n- Add linguistic elements to refine that context\\n- Gradually shift to more AI-driven exploration\\n- Checkpoint and branch their explorations\\nAll within a single workflow.\\n\\n### 5. Clearly Articulate the Platform Architecture\\n\\nExplain the underlying architecture that will allow these capabilities to be shared across products:\\n- Consistent command surface\\n- Shared context management\\n- Cross-product conversation persistence\\n- Common extension points\\n\\n### 6. Position Against Competitors as a Paradigm Shift\\n\\nRather than competing feature-by-feature with Claude Code, position this as a fundamentally different approach to AI assistance - one that gives developers a completely new kind of control over their AI interactions.\\n\\n## Specific Document Structure Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Title**: \\\u0022GitHub Copilot Command: The Next Generation of Developer-Controlled AI Assistance\\\u0022\\n\\n2. **Executive Summary**: Lead with the paradigm shift - the \\\u0022Context Slider\\\u0022 that allows developers to work anywhere on the continuum from fully deterministic to fully AI-driven, with the ability to branch and merge conversational explorations.\\n\\n3. **The Context Slider Paradigm**: Detailed explanation of this new approach to AI interaction, with concrete examples.\\n\\n4. **Why Terminal First**: Explanation of why the terminal environment is the natural first implementation of this paradigm (command orientation, composability, state management).\\n\\n5. **Cross-Product Vision**: How this paradigm will extend across all GitHub products, with specific examples for each surface.\\n\\n6. **Platform Architecture**: The underlying components that will enable this cross-product implementation.\\n\\n7. **Competitive Differentiation**: How this paradigm fundamentally differentiates from other approaches in the market.\\n\\n8. **Implementation Roadmap**: Starting with the CLI but extending across the product suite over time.\\n\\nThis approach addresses the stakeholder comments by:\\n1. Clearly explaining why terminal is the first implementation but not the only one\\n2. Providing concrete details on the unique innovations\\n3. Showing how this connects to the broader GitHub ecosystem\\n4. Presenting a coherent cross-product strategy\\n\\nIt also retains the most compelling aspects of your original vision while addressing the legitimate concerns raised in the comments.\u0022}"},"type":"function"}]}

{"role":"assistant","content":"After digesting your comprehensive thoughts, I see a much clearer vision for what you\u0027re trying to achieve. Let me revise my approach based on this deeper understanding:\n\n# Revised Recommendations for Document Restructuring\n\n## 1. Reframe Around the \u0022Context Slider\u0022 Paradigm, Not Just a CLI Product\n\nYour core innovation is the multi-dimensional \u0022Context Slider\u0022 - a revolutionary approach allowing developers to operate anywhere along multiple continua:\n- Deterministic \u2194 Non-deterministic context building\n- Synchronous \u2194 Asynchronous interaction\n- Command-oriented \u2194 Conversation-oriented workflows\n- Explicit \u2194 Implicit context gathering\n\nThis paradigm shift deserves to be the centerpiece of the document, with the CLI positioned as its natural first implementation, not merely as a competitive product to Claude Code.\n\n## 2. Position the CLI as the Reference Implementation, Not the End Goal\n\nThe terminal environment is the ideal first implementation because:\n- It naturally supports command composition and pipelining\n- Shell sessions are already built around command sequences and state manipulation\n- It offers the richest environment for the full expression of the Context Slider paradigm\n- The command-oriented nature of shells aligns perfectly with explicit context building\n\nRather than defending \u0022why CLI instead of IDE,\u0022 position it as \u0022CLI first, then everywhere\u0022 - with the CLI serving as the reference implementation of capabilities that will eventually extend across all surfaces.\n\n## 3. Articulate the Git-like Conversation Management System\n\nThe ability to checkpoint, branch, and merge conversational explorations is a uniquely powerful concept that deserves much more prominence. This Git-like metaphor for AI interactions would be transformative for long-running development projects and team collaboration.\n\nCreate a dedicated section explaining this system with concrete examples showing how developers can:\n- Save conversational checkpoints at critical decision points\n- Branch to explore alternative approaches\n- Merge insights from different exploration paths\n- Share these conversational branches with team members\n\n## 4. Create Detailed Examples of Cross-Dimensional Workflows\n\nShow how a developer might:\n1. Start with highly deterministic context gathering (\u0060--files \u0022**/*.auth.js\u0022 --contains \u0022login|authenticate\u0022\u0060)\n2. Apply linguistic refinement to that context (\u0060--file-instructions \u0022Extract the authentication flow\u0022\u0060)\n3. Inject that refined context into a broader conversational task\n4. Branch the conversation to explore alternative solutions\n5. Merge those insights back into the main development path\n\nThese examples should demonstrate the full power of operating across all dimensions of the Context Slider.\n\n## 5. Present a Cross-Product Platform Strategy\n\nClarify that while the CLI is the natural first home, these capabilities will extend across all GitHub surfaces:\n\n- **CLI Implementation**: The full, reference implementation with all capabilities\n- **IDE Integration**: Bringing command-oriented context building to VS Code through slash commands and UI affordances\n- **GitHub Web**: Integrating context tools into PR/issue workflows to enhance Project Padawan\n- **Standalone Experiences**: Supporting \u0022Vibe coders\u0022 with visual command builders \n\nEmphasize that the underlying platform architecture will ensure consistency across all these surfaces.\n\n## 6. Address Implementation Questions Directly\n\nInclude a dedicated section on implementation considerations:\n- Relationship to existing \u0060gh\u0060 CLI (extension vs. standalone)\n- Cross-surface architecture for sharing capabilities\n- Standardization of context checkpointing format\n- Model portability and provider strategy\n\n## Proposed Document Structure\n\n1. **Executive Summary**: Lead with the Context Slider paradigm as GitHub\u0027s transformative innovation in AI assistance\n\n2. **The Multi-Dimensional Context Slider**: Detailed explanation of this new paradigm with concrete examples of how it transforms developer workflows\n\n3. **Conversation Management: Git for AI Interactions**: Explain the revolutionary ability to checkpoint, branch, and merge conversational explorations\n\n4. **Why Terminal First**: Articulate why the terminal is the natural first implementation while emphasizing the cross-product vision\n\n5. **Platform Architecture and Cross-Product Strategy**: Show how these capabilities will extend across all GitHub surfaces\n\n6. **Competitive Differentiation**: Frame this as a fundamentally different paradigm rather than a feature-by-feature comparison\n\n7. **Implementation Considerations and Roadmap**: Address practical questions about implementation approach and timeline\n\n8. **User Scenarios**: Revise to show how the same workflows would manifest across different surfaces\n\nThis approach directly addresses the commenters\u0027 questions while preserving your vision of transforming how developers interact with AI through unprecedented control over context and conversation flow.\n\nThe document will be less about \u0022why a CLI instead of IDE features\u0022 and more about \u0022a revolutionary new approach to AI interaction that naturally begins in the terminal but will transform all developer experiences.\u0022"}
