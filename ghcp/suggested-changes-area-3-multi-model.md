# Area 3: Add Multi-Model Support with Intelligent Model Selection

## Current State in the Specification

The GitHub CLI spec currently includes a brief mention of "Provider-Agnostic Intelligence" as the second foundational pillar:

> "Support for multiple AI providers with intelligent task routing that selects the optimal model based on the specific operation, balancing capability, cost, and privacy."

It also lists "Intelligent Model Selection" as a key differentiating capability:

> "Sophisticated orchestration to route different tasks to the appropriate models based on complexity, token requirements, and cost sensitivity."

Additionally, there's a mention of "Cost Optimization" as a competitive differentiator:

> "Intelligent model selection and context refinement versus Claude Code's costly approach."

However, these mentions are high-level and lack specific details about implementation, supported models, selection criteria, and how the system will technically manage multiple models.

## Detailed Recommendations for Enhancement

```bash
# Documentation generation routed to models optimized for natural language
github-copilot "Generate documentation for the user authentication module" \
  --glob "src/auth/**/*.js" \
  --smart-model-selection  # Automatically selects documentation-optimized model

# Performance-critical code optimization routed to specialized code models
github-copilot "Optimize the database query performance" \
  --file "src/database/queries.js" \
  --model-preference performance  # Prioritizes high-quality code generation models

# Security audit using local models for privacy
github-copilot "Audit code for security vulnerabilities" \
  --glob "src/payments/**/*.js" \
  --privacy-sensitive  # Routes to local models for sensitive code analysis

# Cost-efficient batch processing of documentation updates
github-copilot "Update all API endpoint documentation to the new format" \
  --glob "src/api/**/*.js" \
  --cost-efficient  # Batches operations and uses economical models
```
```

### 7. Add a Model Configuration Guide

Include guidance on setting up and managing multiple models:

```markdown
### Model Configuration Guide

GitHub Copilot CLI provides flexible configuration options for managing multiple AI providers:

#### Provider Configuration

```json
// Example .github-copilot-cli config
{
  "providers": {
    "github-copilot": {
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 1,
      "auth": "enterprise"  // Uses GitHub Enterprise credentials
    },

        "mistral": { "enabled": true, "usage": ["fallback"] }
      }
    }
  },
  "model_selection": {
    "strategy": "intelligent",  // intelligent, fixed, or round-robin
    "cost_sensitivity": "balanced",  // economy, balanced, or performance
    "privacy_filter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sensitive_patterns": ["password", "api[-_]key", "secret", "credential"]
    }
  }

      "fallback": "openai.gpt-4"
    },
    "documentation": {
      "preferred_provider": "openai.gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "fallback": "local.mistral"
    },
    "security-audit": {
      "preferred_provider": "local.codellama",
      "fallback": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet",
      "force_privacy": true
    }
  }
}
```
```

## Integration with Existing Content

These multi-model intelligence enhancements should be integrated with the existing specification while maintaining the document's overall flow and vision. The additions provide concrete details about how the system will implement the provider-agnostic intelligence mentioned in the original specification, addressing the concern about token-based pricing and limited model options noted in user feedback.

By adding these details to the specification, GitHub demonstrates a comprehensive approach to leveraging multiple AI models while giving users control over cost, performance, and privacy tradeoffs. This would clearly differentiate GitHub Copilot CLI from single-provider solutions like Claude Code and address a key limitation identified in the market analysis.
