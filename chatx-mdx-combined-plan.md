# CycoDev Integration Plan

## Vision

CycoDev (`cycod`) will unify the complementary capabilities of MDX and CHATX into a single, cohesive tool that empowers developers to leverage AI throughout their workflow. By combining MDX's powerful context gathering with CHATX's robust chat capabilities, CycoDev will create a seamless experience for:

1. Gathering context from files, commands, and the web
2. Interacting with AI through chat
3. Processing and transforming information with AI assistance
4. Managing configurations, prompts, and tool integrations

The unified tool will maintain the distinct workflows that make each original tool powerful while creating a consistent interface, terminology, and user experience.

## Core Principles

1. **Purpose-Specific Terminology**: Use terms that reflect the different mental models of context gathering vs. chat operations
2. **Command Consistency**: Provide a predictable command structure across all operations
3. **Provider Unification**: Use a single, consistent framework for AI provider management
4. **Configuration Coherence**: Build on a unified configuration system with scope awareness
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple operations should be simple; complexity should only be added as needed
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Support migration paths for users of existing tools

## Command Structure

CycoDev will organize commands according to their function:

```
cycod chat                    # Chat with AI (interactive or non-interactive)
cycod find                    # Find files and process with AI
cycod run                     # Run commands and process output with AI
cycod web search              # Search the web and process results with AI
cycod web get                 # Get web page content and process with AI

cycod config                  # Configuration management
cycod alias                   # Command alias management
cycod prompt                  # Prompt template management
cycod mcp                     # Model Context Protocol server management
cycod github                  # GitHub integration
cycod help                    # Help system
```

## Feature-by-Feature Plan

### 1. Command Structure Reorganization

**Motivation**:
- Creating a consistent command structure improves discoverability and learnability
- Moving chat to a subcommand clarifies that the tool serves multiple purposes
- Keeping `find` and `run` at the top level acknowledges their distinct roles
- Grouping web commands reflects their related nature

**Work Items**:
- Move CHATX's default behavior to `cycod chat`
- Implement `cycod find` for file finding/processing operations
- Implement `cycod run` for command execution/processing
- Create `cycod web` subcommand group with `search` and `get` operations
- Ensure all configuration commands (`config`, `alias`, `prompt`, `mcp`) maintain their current structure
- Make `cycod` with no arguments default to `cycod chat` for smoother transition
- Create built-in aliases for common transitions (e.g., `cycod c` â†’ `cycod chat`)

### 2. Chat Operations

**Motivation**:
- Chat interactions have different usage patterns and needs than context gathering
- Users need both interactive and non-interactive chat capabilities
- Adding summarization capabilities enhances chat functionality
- Maintaining consistent history management is critical for ongoing conversations

**Work Items**:

- Add new summarization capabilities:
  - `--summary-instructions` - For providing directions on how to summarize/condense a chat
  - `--save-summary` - For saving the summarized chat output
  - Default summarization behavior when only `--save-summary` is provided
- Maintain history management options:
  - `--continue` - Continue most recent chat
  - `--chat-history` - Load from and save to same file
  - `--input-chat-history` - Load from specific file
  - `--output-chat-history` - Save to specific file
  - `--output-trajectory` - Save human-readable history
- Ensure slash commands continue to integrate with context gathering operations

### 3. Context Gathering Operations

**Motivation**:
- Context gathering operations have different workflows than chat
- Users need specialized options for different context sources
