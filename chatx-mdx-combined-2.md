# Naming Analysis: Cyco Dev

## Name Evaluation

### "Cyco Dev" as Product Name

After analysis, we're strongly leaning toward using "Cyco Dev" as the product name due to its marketing potential and brand extensibility.

#### Strengths:
- **AI Association**: The "Cyco" prefix evokes cybernetics and AI, aligning with the tool's purpose
- **Developer Focus**: "Dev" clearly positions it as a developer-focused tool
- **Distinctiveness**: The name stands out compared to many technical tool names
- **Memorability**: It's relatively short and has a rhythm that makes it memorable
- **Marketing Potential**: Enables catchy taglines like "It's so good, it's crazy!" or "It's crazy good"
- **Brand Expansion**: Can extend to related products (e.g., "Cyco Tester", "Cyco Browser")
- **Community Identity**: Users can identify as "Cyco Devs," creating community around the tool
- **Domain Secured**: cyco.ai domain is already secured

#### Concerns:
- **Pronunciation Ambiguity**: Users might be uncertain whether to pronounce it as "psycho-dev", "sigh-co dev", or "sigh-ko dev"
- **Potential Misassociation**: The spelling "Cyco" could be visually associated with "psycho" in some contexts
- **Abstraction Level**: The name doesn't directly convey the tool's specific capabilities

#### Why We're Choosing This Direction:
The name "Cyco Dev" represents the cybernetic partnership between developers and AI that is core to the tool's philosophy. While there are some concerns, the marketing potential and ability to build a brand family outweigh these issues. The name's memorability and potential to create user identity ("I'm a Cyco Dev") provide strong advantages for adoption and community building.

## Command-Line Executable Name

### `cycod` vs `cdv`

After weighing the options, we're leaning toward **`cycod`** as the executable name.

#### `cdv` Advantages:
- **Brevity**: Only 3 characters, making it faster to type
- **Simplicity**: Easy to remember and type quickly
- **Convention**: Follows the pattern of short CLI tool names (git, npm, pip)

#### `cycod` Advantages:
- **Typing Ergonomics**: Letters alternate between hands on standard keyboards (`cdv` is awkwardly left-hand dominant)
- **Distinctiveness**: Less likely to conflict with existing commands or aliases
- **Brand Connection**: More clearly connects to the "Cyco Dev" product name
- **Memorability**: Easier to remember association with the full product name
- **Flow**: Creates a more fluid typing experience for repetitive use

#### Why We're Choosing This Direction:
While `cdv` is shorter, the improved ergonomics of `cycod` provide a better user experience for a command that will be typed frequently. The alternating left-right hand pattern of `cycod` creates a more natural typing flow compared to the awkward left-hand clustering of `cdv`. Additionally, the stronger connection between `cycod` and "Cyco Dev" helps with brand consistency and memorability.

For commands that developers use dozens of times daily, typing experience becomes increasingly important. The two additional characters are a small price to pay for better ergonomics and brand alignment. Modern shells also offer command history, aliases, and tab completion, which reduce the impact of the slightly longer command.

## Implementation Plan

Before finalizing the name, we should:

1. **Conduct User Testing**: Get feedback on both the product name and executable name from potential users
2. **Create Visual Identity**: Develop branding that reinforces the cybernetic partnership concept
3. **Test Command Experience**: Have developers use `cycod` vs alternatives in realistic workflows
4. **Marketing Messaging**: Develop initial marketing materials that leverage the "Cyco" concept and taglines

## Overall Naming Strategy

Our naming approach prioritizes these elements:
- **Brand Extensibility**: The ability to create a family of "Cyco" products
- **Memorable Identity**: A name that stands out and creates community
- **Ergonomic Usage**: Command names that feel good to type repeatedly
- **Marketing Potential**: Names that enable creative, catchy marketing

The "Cyco Dev" name and `cycod` executable offer the best balance of these priorities while creating a foundation for future product development.
