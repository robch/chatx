# Azure OpenAI Portal Screenshot

This file represents a placeholder for a screenshot showing the Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal.

In an actual implementation, this would be replaced with a real image file (png/jpg) showing:

1. Azure Portal interface with Azure OpenAI resource open
2. The "Keys and Endpoint" section visible
3. The endpoint URL highlighted
4. The API keys section visible (with keys blurred/redacted for security)

The image would help users visually identify where to find their endpoint and API keys in the Azure Portal.
