# Azure OpenAI Deployments Screenshot

This file represents a placeholder for a screenshot showing the Azure OpenAI deployments section in the Azure Portal.

In an actual implementation, this would be replaced with a real image file (png/jpg) showing:

1. Azure Portal navigation to Azure OpenAI resource
2. The "Deployments" section highlighted
3. A list of deployments with their names clearly visible
4. The "Name" column highlighted

The image would help users visually identify where to find their deployment names.
