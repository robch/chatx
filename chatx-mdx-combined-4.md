# Migration Path for Unified Cyco Dev Tool

## Overview

When merging two established tools like `mdx` and `chatx` into a unified `cdv` (Cyco Dev) tool, providing a thoughtful migration path is critical for user adoption and satisfaction. This document outlines recommendations for ensuring a smooth transition for existing users of both tools.

## Migration Strategy Recommendations

### Installation and Transition

1. **Unified Installer with Legacy Support**
   - The new `cdv` installer should automatically handle migration from both `mdx` and `chatx`
   - Detect existing installations and offer to migrate settings, aliases, and prompts
   - Provide an option to keep legacy executables functioning during transition period

2. **Command Compatibility Layer**
   - Create lightweight wrapper executables for `mdx` and `chatx` that redirect to `cdv` with appropriate command mapping
   - Example: When user runs `mdx **/*.js`, it internally executes `cdv find **/*.js`
   - Example: When user runs `chatx --question "Why?"`, it internally executes `cdv chat --question "Why?"`

3. **Built-in Deprecation Notices**
   - When users run legacy commands through the compatibility wrappers, display a small notice:
     ```
     Note: 'mdx' is now part of Cyco Dev. Try 'cdv find' for the same functionality.

     (This notice can be disabled with --no-upgrade-notice)
     ```
   - Include a timeline for when legacy commands will be deprecated

### Documentation and Guidance

1. **Migration Guide**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on how commands map from old to new
   - Include a command reference table showing equivalents
   - Create examples showing "before and after" for common workflows

2. **Command Suggestion System**
   - When using deprecated commands, suggest equivalent new commands:
     ```
     $ mdx web search "AI"
     [Result output...]
     
     Tip: This command is now available as: cdv web search "AI"
     ```

3. **Update Detection**
   - When a new version is released that changes command behavior, show migration notices specifically for those changes

### Special Considerations

1. **Script and Automation Support**
   - Ensure compatibility wrappers maintain exit codes and output formats
   - Provide a script-analysis tool to help identify and update automated workflows
   - Create a `--legacy-output` flag for maintaining backward compatibility of outputs

2. **Configuration and Settings Migration**
   - Automatically migrate configuration settings (.chatx â†’ .cdv)
   - Preserve environment variable compatibility
   - Support both old and new config locations during transition period

3. **Alias System for Transition**
   - Create automatic aliases that map legacy commands to new structure
   - Allow users to define their own command mappings

## Proposed Timeline

1. **Alpha/Beta Phase (3 months)**
   - Release `cdv` alongside existing tools
   - Gather feedback on migration experience
   - Improve compatibility based on user reports

2. **Initial Release (Month 0)**
   - Full release with compatibility wrappers
   - Legacy tools installed but show migration notices

3. **Transition Period (12 months)**
   - Continue supporting legacy commands
   - Gradually increase prominence of migration notices

4. **Legacy Deprecation (Month 12+)**
   - Legacy wrappers optionally installed but not by default
   - Focus documentation and support on new command structure

## Conclusion

A successful migration strategy balances respect for existing users' workflows with the benefits of the new unified tool structure. By providing compatibility layers, clear documentation, and a reasonable transition timeline, users can migrate at their own pace while still benefiting from ongoing improvements to the tooling.

The goal should be to make migration so seamless that users naturally adopt the new command structure because it's more intuitive and powerful, not because they're forced to change.
