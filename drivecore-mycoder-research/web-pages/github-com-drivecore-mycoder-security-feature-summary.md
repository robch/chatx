The text provided does not directly list the features of the mycoder CLI, as it seems to be more focused on the general GitHub interface and features. However, based on the context that mycoder is an AI-based CLI tool similar to Anthropoic's Claude Code or GitHub Copilot CLI, one can infer some typical features an AI-based developer tool might have:

1. **AI Code Assistance**: Helps developers write better code by generating code suggestions, completion, and potentially debugging tips.
2. **Security Integration**: Features related to finding and fixing vulnerabilities, as noted under the Security menu.
3. **Workflow Automation**: Likely integrates with GitHub Actions to automate development workflows.
4. **Code Review and Management**: May assist in managing code changes, reviews, and version control.
5. **Collaboration Support**: Offers features for developers to collaborate outside of direct code contributions, possibly through discussions or shared projects.
6. **Advanced Security Features**: Given the mention of advanced security, it might offer enterprise-grade security for code and projects.
7. **Learning and Documentation Resources**: Likely provides access to documentation and learning pathways to improve user skills and knowledge.
8. **Open Source Support**: Might include features that facilitate contributing to and managing open source projects.

While these are typical features aligned with the specification of an AI-based CLI like GitHub Copilot CLI, the specific features of mycoder CLI were not directly listed in the provided text.
