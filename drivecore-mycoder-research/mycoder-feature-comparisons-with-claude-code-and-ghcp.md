Now that I have a good understanding of all three tools, I'll create a comprehensive comparison of MyCoder, Claude Code, and the proposed GitHub Copilot CLI.

# Comprehensive Comparison: MyCoder vs. Claude Code vs. Proposed GitHub Copilot CLI

## 1. Overview and Core Philosophy

### MyCoder
MyCoder is an AI-powered command-line tool designed to help developers accomplish a wide range of software development tasks through natural language commands. Its philosophy centers on integrating AI assistance directly into existing development workflows, with a focus on flexibility, multi-provider support, and GitHub integration.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
mycoder "Create a persistent configuration system that allows users to set default values for command line options"
```

### Claude Code
Claude Code is a terminal-based AI coding assistant developed by Anthropic that enables developers to interact with Claude directly from their command-line interface. Its philosophy is to serve as an AI pair programmer within the familiar terminal environment, with deep codebase understanding and comprehensive capabilities for modifying code and executing commands.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
claude "Please create a configuration system that persists user preferences"
```

### Proposed GitHub Copilot CLI
The proposed GitHub Copilot CLI represents a next-generation terminal-based AI development environment focused on developer-controlled context gathering. Its philosophy centers on empowering developers with unprecedented control over how context is collected, refined, and used by the AI, positioning the developer as the "superhero" who chooses how and when to leverage AI assistance.

**Example Usage (Proposed):**
```bash
github-copilot "Create a configuration system" --glob "**/*.{js,ts}" \
  --file-contains "config|settings" \
  --file-instructions "Analyze how configuration is currently handled"
```

```bash
# Start Claude Code in the repository
claude
# Then in the CLI
Please implement a dark mode feature for our React application. The design system guidelines are in the components/design folder.
```
Claude Code would analyze the design system, make the necessary code changes, and could commit the changes after user approval.

**Proposed GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**
```bash
# Systematic implementation with explicit context gathering
github-copilot "Implement dark mode" \
  --glob "src/components/**/*.{jsx,tsx}" \
  --file-contains "theme|style|color" \
  --references "DesignSystem" \
  --instructions "Implement dark mode following our design system guidelines" \
  --create-branch "feature/dark-mode" \
  --prepare-pr "Add dark mode support"
```
GitHub Copilot CLI would systematically gather design system knowledge, implement changes across relevant files, and prepare a pull request.

### Example 2: Debugging a Complex Issue

**MyCoder Approach:**
```bash
mycoder "Debug why our authentication system occasionally fails for users with special characters in their usernames. The relevant code is in src/auth and src/utils/validation.js."
```
MyCoder would analyze the authentication system, identify issues with special character handling, and suggest fixes.

**Claude Code Approach:**
```bash
claude "I'm debugging an issue where our authentication system occasionally fails for users with special characters in their usernames. Can you help me find the root cause? The relevant code is in src/auth and src/utils/validation.js."
```
Claude Code would examine the code in those directories, potentially run tests, and help identify character encoding or validation issues.

**Proposed GitHub Copilot CLI Approach:**
```bash
github-copilot "Debug authentication failures" \
  --glob "src/auth/**/*.js" \
  --glob "src/utils/validation.js" \
  --file-contains "username|validate|sanitize" \
  --run "grep -r 'special.*char' src/" \
  --file-instructions "Look for improper handling of special characters" \
  --save-output "debugging/auth-special-chars-analysis.md"
```
GitHub Copilot CLI would systematically examine all relevant files, run commands to find related code, and provide a detailed analysis of the issue.
