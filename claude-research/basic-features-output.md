Here are 3-5 suggested edits for improving the ghcp/github-cli-spec-2.md based on the information in the claude-research\basic-features.md file:

1. **Terminal Integration Feature**: Incorporate a feature similar to "Terminal Integration" from Claude Code that emphasizes the advantages of having a CLI tool, such as eliminating the need for separate browser windows or user interfaces. This could improve usability for developers who prefer working within their terminal environments.

2. **Code Understanding and Cross-File Context**: Add enhancements related to "Code Understanding" that could provide the capability to scan and understand the architecture of the codebase. Introducing features for cross-file context could help in comprehending relationships between various code files and components in a project.

3. **Reasoning and Planning**: Integrate features that offer "Reasoning and Planning" similar to Claude Code's approach. This could involve structured reasoning to tackle complex tasks and a multi-step planning capability to break down tasks into more manageable steps.

4. **Security Features**: Suggest the addition of a "Permission System" to control sensitive operations and ensure secure file and command access. This would involve implementing a tiered approval system for handling secure/delicate tasks more reliably.

5. **Execution Capabilities**: Consider adding functionality for "Execution Capabilities," including running shell commands with approval, handling test executions, and managing build processes. These features could ensure better integration with development workflows by executing necessary processes directly through the CLI.
