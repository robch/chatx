To align with the current ghcp/github-cli-spec-2.md content and introduce new ideas without significant alterations, consider the following suggested edits:

1. **Universal Platform Support Enhancement**: Emphasize the importance of native cross-platform support and the ability to sync cloud and local environments. Suggest introducing support for containerized deployments and mobile companions focusing on reviewing and voice inputs.

2. **Multi-Modal AI Integration Introduction**: Propose the inclusion of provider-agnostic AI integration. This would allow seamless switching between different AI models based on task demands for better flexibility and cost management.

3. **Innovative Features Highlight**: Briefly suggest integrating adaptive context management with dynamic context windows and code embeddings. This can enhance codebase awareness and improve code relationship understanding.

4. **Voice-Driven Development Mention**: Briefly introduce voice-driven development to offer multimodal interactions and voice personas. This would add a modern, user-friendly aspect to terminal development environments.

5. **Cost Management Strategy Addition**: Recommend incorporating strategies for flexible pricing and cost control mechanisms. Highlight different pricing options and smart token allocation that can optimize costs based on usage and requirements.

These edits will enhance the existing spec by focusing on cross-platform capabilities, AI flexibility, innovative user interactions, and robust cost management without requiring substantial changes.
