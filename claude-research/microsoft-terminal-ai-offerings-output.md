I'll help you with this task. First, let's examine the GitHub CLI spec file to understand what it contains and then compare it with the Microsoft terminal AI offerings document to identify potential edits.

Now that I have read both documents, I can identify what's missing in the GitHub CLI spec compared to the Microsoft Terminal AI Offerings document. Here are my suggested edits to the GitHub CLI spec:

## Suggested Edits for ghcp/github-cli-spec-2.md

1. **Add Current Windows Terminal Integration Context**: The spec doesn't mention how GitHub Copilot CLI would integrate with Windows Terminal specifically. I would add a paragraph in the "Platform Excellence" section that addresses native Windows Terminal integration with optimized experiences, highlighting the importance of a seamless experience for Windows users without requiring WSL.

2. **Expand Competitive Analysis with Current GitHub Copilot CLI**: While the spec mentions the current GitHub Copilot CLI capabilities briefly, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the existing command suggestion and explanation features. This would establish a clearer foundation for what the next-generation tool would build upon.

3. **Add Free Tier Strategy**: The spec doesn't address accessibility through a free tier offering. I would add a section about implementing a limited free tier (similar to the 50 queries per month mentioned in the research document) to increase adoption and create an upgrade path to paid subscriptions.

4. **Strengthen Cross-Platform Support Details**: While the spec mentions cross-platform support, it could be more explicit about the implementation strategies for ensuring an equally powerful experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux, with specifics about shell-aware responses for different environments.

5. **Include Command Execution Permission Model**: The spec could benefit from explicitly addressing the security model around command execution permissions. I would add details about implementing a tiered permission system that allows users to control whether the CLI can suggest commands only, copy to clipboard, or execute commands directly with user confirmation.

These edits would enhance the GitHub CLI spec by incorporating key insights from the Microsoft Terminal AI Offerings research while maintaining the focus on GitHub Copilot CLI as a comprehensive terminal-based AI assistant, without referencing MDX, CHATX, or other Microsoft research projects directly.
