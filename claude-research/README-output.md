I'll help you with suggesting edits for the GitHub CLI spec based on the Claude Code research document. First, let me check the GitHub CLI spec to understand what it contains and what might be missing.

Now, let me analyze what might be missing from the GitHub CLI spec compared to the Claude Code research document and suggest 3-5 potential edits.

## ghcp/github-cli-spec-2.md - Suggested Edits

Based on the Claude research document, here are my 5 suggested edits to the GitHub CLI spec:

1. **Add a section on user feedback considerations**: The research document mentions specific user concerns about Claude Code, such as cost, response times, and Windows integration. The spec should include a section that explicitly addresses how GitHub Copilot CLI will manage these pain points. This could be added to the "Competitive Differentiation" section with more emphasis on how user feedback has directly informed feature design.

2. **Expand on the code quality focus**: The research document notes that users specifically appreciate Claude Code's "code quality and deep understanding." While the spec mentions many powerful features, it could more explicitly highlight how GitHub Copilot CLI will maintain or exceed Claude Code's high standards for generated code quality, perhaps with specific quality metrics or validation approaches.

3. **Add cross-tool context sharing**: The research mentions that Claude Code represents a "significant advancement in terminal-based AI coding." The spec could be enhanced to explicitly include how context and insights gathered in GitHub Copilot CLI could be shared with other tools in the GitHub ecosystem (not just IDE integration, but also with other terminal sessions and team members).

4. **Include a clearer learning/onboarding strategy**: The research emphasizes how the terminal-based AI coding assistant space is "still evolving." The spec should include more detail on how GitHub Copilot CLI will help developers learn and adapt to this new paradigm, perhaps with built-in tutorials, graduated autonomy levels, or interactive learning modes.

5. **Address ecosystem integration more comprehensively**: While the spec mentions GitHub integration, the research emphasizes the importance of a "unified solution" rather than "fragmented specialized tools." The spec could more explicitly define how GitHub Copilot CLI fits into a complete developer workflow that includes other development tools beyond just GitHub's offerings - including compatibility with popular terminal tools, shell integration points, and extension mechanisms.

These suggested edits would help ensure the GitHub CLI spec addresses the key insights from the Claude Code research while maintaining the current structure and direction of the specification.
