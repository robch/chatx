I'll help you analyze what's in the terminal-based AI coding assistants research document that might be missing from the GitHub CLI specification. First, let me check the GitHub CLI specification to understand what's already there.

Now that I've analyzed both documents, I can suggest 3-5 edits that could be made to the GitHub CLI spec based on insights from the terminal-based AI coding assistants research.

## Terminal-Based AI Coding Tools Suggestions

Based on the comprehensive comparison of terminal-based AI coding assistants, here are my suggested edits for the GitHub CLI spec:

1. **Add Multi-Model Support Details**: The spec mentions "provider-agnostic intelligence" but could benefit from more specific details about supporting multiple AI models like Aider does. Consider adding explicit mentions of support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models through a plugin system, which would enhance flexibility for developers with different preferences or requirements.

2. **Enhance Git Integration Capabilities**: While the spec mentions GitHub integration, it could be strengthened by incorporating the deep git workflow features highlighted in Aider's implementation - specifically automatic commit generation with descriptive messages and repository mapping to help the LLM understand code structure. This would differentiate GitHub Copilot CLI further from basic terminal assistants.

3. **Include Terminal UI Considerations**: The research document highlights terminal UI as an important aspect of user experience. The spec could benefit from details about the planned terminal interface - whether it will be purely text-based or include more interactive elements, and how the UI would adapt across different terminal environments (bash, PowerShell, etc.).

4. **Add Slash Command System**: Implement a robust slash command system similar to Aider's 30+ commands that was highlighted in the research. This would provide users with efficient shortcuts for common operations without leaving the terminal flow. This could complement the context-gathering commands already specified.

5. **Include Testing/Linting Integration**: The research mentions Aider's automatic code validation after changes through linting and testing. Adding similar capabilities to the GitHub Copilot CLI spec would strengthen its position as a complete development environment rather than just a code generation tool.

These suggested edits would help incorporate some of the strongest features identified in the terminal-based AI coding assistants research while maintaining the unique vision and approach of the GitHub Copilot CLI specification.
