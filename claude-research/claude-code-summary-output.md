1. **Add Codebase Understanding Feature**: Incorporate a feature similar to Claude Code's "Codebase Understanding" capability. This would allow the GitHub CLI to gain insights into the architecture, logic, and implementation details of entire codebases, enhancing its ability to provide context-aware assistance within the CLI.

2. **Introduce a Permission System**: Like Claude Code, implement a tiered permission system that distinguishes between read operations, command executions, and file modifications. This would enhance security and user control within the GitHub CLI.

3. **Integrate Extended Thinking Mechanism**: Propose the addition of a special "thinking" mode to deal with complex tasks through more structured reasoning, similar to the extended thinking feature in Claude Code. This could improve the GitHub CLI's capability to handle intricate queries or operations.

4. **Support for Cross-Platform Code Management**: Suggest ensuring cross-platform compatibility, allowing GitHub CLI to work seamlessly on macOS, Linux, and Windows with terminal support, akin to the cross-platform support in Claude Code.

5. **Cost Structure Transparency**: Although cost structure might not directly apply to the GitHub CLI the way it does for Claude Code, suggesting a transparency mechanism for users concerning any operation costs within the GitHub ecosystem could be beneficial, especially if API interactions are involved.
