## What Users Don't Like About Claude Code

### Cost Concerns
- "Claude Code charged $4.69 for three simple changes, this per-change pricing can add up quickly" - Medium user
- "As with anything involving the Anthropic API, costs can accumulate quickly... can exceed $100 per hour (Intensive usage)" - Helicone
- "It's expensive. Perhaps not so much in absolute terms, but definitely in relative terms" - Rafael Quintanilha

### Response Times
- "Users have noted formatting issues and significant waiting times" - Helicone
- "Response time remains one of the most notable drawbacks compared to IDE-integrated tools like Cursor" - Helicone
- "In vibe mode tends to be imprecise—sometimes taking longer and inflating context" - Rafael Quintanilha

### Limited Context Control
- "When precise context is crucial, Cursor is the clear winner. Its ability to control exactly what code is fed into the model helps tailor responses precisely" - Rafael Quintanilha
- "In Claude Code, there's no practical way to tag files, only to describe them verbally" - Rafael Quintanilha
- "It occasionally struggles with wider context management in larger, complex codebases" - User feedback

### Limitations with Complex Projects
- "Despite its celebrated capabilities, Claude Code is not without limitations" - OpenTools.ai
- "Its challenge in handling complex engineering tasks where intricate real-world applications demand higher intervention levels" - OpenTools.ai
- "It might produce redundant or non-reviewable code, indicating that manual oversight is still necessary" - OpenTools.ai

### Technical Issues
- "There have been reports of inefficiencies relating to its auto-update feature and system file ownership issues on certain OS configurations" - OpenTools.ai
