# Claude Code vs Microsoft CLI AI Tools Comparison

This document compares Anthropic's Claude Code to Microsoft's terminal-based AI tools, including the ChatX project in development and their existing GitHub Copilot terminal offerings. Based on our analysis of the respective codebases and capabilities, here's how they compare:

## Microsoft's Terminal AI Landscape

Before diving into the comparison, it's important to understand Microsoft's current offerings in the terminal AI space:

1. **GitHub Copilot CLI** (`gh copilot`): A GitHub CLI extension that provides command explanations and suggestions
2. **Windows Terminal Chat**: An integrated chat feature in Windows Terminal Canary that connects to GitHub Copilot
3. **ChatX**: An experimental CLI project being developed at Microsoft as a more comprehensive terminal-based AI assistant
