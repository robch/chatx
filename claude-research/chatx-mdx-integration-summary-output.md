1. **Include Terminal Development Environment Feature**: Suggest adding a feature that focuses on creating a more unified terminal experience for developers. This could involve integrating a seamless command interface that enhances existing terminal workflows without explicitly naming or referring to any specific third-party tools or frameworks.

2. **Enhance Context Awareness**: Incorporate more advanced context awareness capabilities that allow the CLI to generate context automatically, improving user experience by reducing the need for manual input. This would indirectly reflect the emphasis on making the CLI smarter without specifying tools or partnerships.

3. **Introduce Provider Flexibility**: Implement system enhancements that allow for greater flexibility in choosing AI or automation providers, thereby sustaining multiple providers with smart routing to optimize tasks. Ensure the CLI remains open and adaptable to different sources and models.

4. **Focus on Integration with Microsoft Ecosystems**: Without naming MDX or similar tools, recommend better integration with Microsoft ecosystems such as Visual Studio and Azure, emphasizing seamless operations across these platforms to leverage their strengths fully.

5. **Phased Implementation Roadmap**: Suggest adopting a phased implementation strategy to introduce new features methodically and ensure a smooth transition. This reflects a strategic approach to innovation while managing risk and adaptation within existing structures.
