1. **Incorporate Terminal-First Experiences**: Introduce support for terminal-first workflows by enabling CLI interactions that recognize developers' tendencies to work within terminal environments. This could involve adding functions or shortcuts that facilitate coding and management directly from the terminal, aligning with developers who favor streamlined command-line operations.

2. **Expand Multi-Modal Input Capabilities**: Consider adding support for multi-modal interactions within the CLI, allowing users to input tasks or interpret results using additional media forms such as screenshots or voice commands. This would enrich user interaction beyond text and align with emerging practices in AI tool interfaces.

3. **Enhance Local Model Support**: Include features that allow the service to work with local models, ensuring privacy and offline capabilities. This can be an option for tasks required to be executed in environments with restricted internet access, enhancing both flexibility and security for enterprise users.

4. **Integrate GitOps Functionality**: Strengthen integration with Git workflows, possibly by automatically recognizing repository structures, offering commit suggestions, and linking with CI/CD pipelines. This would facilitate seamless git operations from within the CLI, reflecting a growing trend in development activities.

5. **Focus on Enterprise Readiness**: Address the needs of enterprise users by adding features that support team collaboration, security, and compliance within the CLI. This can include role-based access, team-wide configuration sharing, and audit logging to ensure that the tool meets the needs of larger, security-conscious development environments.
