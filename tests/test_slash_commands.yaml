    command: chatx --input "/files *.py
    
    Can you list the Python files you found?"
    expect: |
      The output should either:
      1. List Python files if MDX is installed and files are found
      2. Indicate that it attempted to search for Python files
      3. Mention that MDX integration is not available

  - name: Simulate find slash command
    command: chatx --input "/find \"def \"\n\nWhat Python functions did you find?"
    expect: |
      The output should either:
      1. List Python functions found if MDX is installed
      2. Indicate that it attempted to search for function definitions
      3. Mention that MDX integration is not available

  # in an actual interactive session for full verification
  - name: Simulate clear command
    command: chatx --input "What is 2+2?\n\n/clear\n\nDo you remember what I asked before?"
    expect: |
      The output should include an answer to 2+2
      The output should indicate that it doesn't remember the previous question
      The response should show evidence that the conversation was cleared

  - name: Simulate save command
    steps:
    - name: Create a conversation and save it
      command: chatx --input "Tell me a joke.\n\n/save temp-saved-chat.jsonl"
      expect: |
